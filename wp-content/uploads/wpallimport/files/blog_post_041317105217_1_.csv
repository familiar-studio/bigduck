So if you write about it, people will read it, right?</p>
<p>Alas, not necessarily. These days, we writers need to trick even our most faithful audiences into reading our precious, precious words.</p>
<p>“Writing visually” is a good first step toward this reader trickery.</p>
<h3>Designers can help you. You can help designers.</h3>
<p>A good designer can make your prose visually pleasing and easy to read. But you can get a good start yourself and help guide a designer into making the most important parts of what you write also the most readable.</p>
<p>Already in this document, I’ve used a title, several short paragraphs, and a heading. If you’re skimming this article, I’ve written it in a way to guide your eyes through the biggest ideas.</p>
<h3>It starts on the page.</h3>
<p>Most of us use Microsoft Word® for our word processing needs. As much as possible I try to avoid any of the auto-formatting functions in Word®. The reasons are too numerous to get into in this little article, but an important one is that auto-formatting can drive designers crazy. Designers just want good clean words. And creating text boxes or using other desktop publishing functions is a surefire way to find yourself removed from your designer’s holiday card list. All those things do is create more work for the designer, and whether you’re paying a freelancer, working with an agency, or handing it over to a staff designer, it’s ultimately a waste of resources. And who can afford to waste resources in this economy? That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think about how the copy will look as you write. I like to use boldface type for headings (as demonstrated in this essay). I’ll indicate in brackets, as a note to our design team, if I think something is worthy of a callout. (A callout is a blurb set apart visually from the main text.) I’ll occasionally throw in some italics for sub-headings or other ideas important to stress when boldface isn’t appropriate. I rarely use the underlining function anymore, especially since it’ll only be confusing if what I’m writing will be published online (links to other sites are, after all, usually underlined). I also double-space between paragraphs. And I tend to create a lot of new paragraphs. Screenwriters call it “dropping a line of white.” Sometimes it’s called white space. A designer might refer to it as negative space. Whatever the name, those hard returns help keep text easy on the eyes. Like Penelope Cruz. Or Jude Law. Except they’re words instead of freakish good looks. Perhaps I use too many hard returns for most grammarians’ tastes, but I’d rather have my audience read what I write than be technically correct. If you happen to know my 7th grade grammar teacher Miss Schaefer, please don’t rat me out. She was tough.</p>
<p>And, suffering <em>cats</em>, that got to be a long paragraph. Did you read the whole thing? Or did you skip ahead to this?</p>
<p>For the purposes of an online essay such as this one, I’d probably take my own advice about the use of paragraphs and of double-spacing between them. I’d write a few sub-headings, also. So let’s see how that long paragraph looks when I write visually right here in my Microsoft Word® document:</p>
<h3 style=""padding-left: 30px;"" class=""alt"">Auto-formatting destroys relationships.</h3>

<p>A lot easier to read, isn’t it? It’s also a lot easier to pick up the important ideas if you only skim it. The multiple paragraph approach takes up a lot more space. But that’s a good thing, too. It will help you keep your word count down.</p>
<p>And the fewer words you write, the more likely it is your audience will read it.</p>
<h3>For better or worse, technology affects how we read.</h3>
<p>Writing visually is especially important when developing copy for your website. Give your readers’ eyes a break. A giant block of text on a monitor will frustrate your readers, especially since people read a lot slower on screen than in print.</p>
<p>I’ve even noticed that as I’ve gone increasingly green with my reading habits — online newspapers, magazines, and even novels, stories, and scripts — how I read an actual book has changed. I now find myself jarred by the long paragraphs found in novels. When I see those enormous blocks of text with no break, my mind struggles to take it all in. (Ah, the perils of copywriting.)</p>
<p>But if I accept that my personal experience isn’t isolated, I think that all of this online reading we do now is changing how we respond to print media. So the “writing visually” practice will benefit you in your brochures, annual reports, and other text-heavy printed materials you may produce during any given year.</p>
<p><strong>Step it down, baby.</strong><br />To write visually, you should think hierarchically about what you’re writing. Remember the outlines your English teacher made you do in high school? If you were anything like me, you’d write the paper first, and then create an outline to match.</p>
<p>But thinking of your prose as an outline can help you write visually. Here’s a typical breakdown:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Big Idea (a.k.a. headline)</strong><br />A statement here that summarizes the Big Idea could well be the only sentence other than the headline that people read — knock socks off with it.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The most important backup support statement goes first.</li>
<li>Think of these backup points as an opportunity to say more, but continue to keep it brief.</li>
<li>Limit your bulleted list as much as you can. Don’t overwhelm with bullets.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If what you’re writing seems too formal or is otherwise inappropriate for bullet points, create new paragraphs liberally instead, as I’ve done throughout.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Also, using the sheer number of headings that I’ve used throughout this essay won’t always be appropriate for what you’re writing. When you can’t break up the prose with headings and sub-headings, etc., it’s even more important to rely on frequent new paragraphs to help you reach your readers.</p>
<h3>It’s the same monitor, after all.</h3>
<p>Thinking of your prose as an outline will especially help you when developing copy for your website. After all, if you’re using a word processing program on a computer, you’re looking at a monitor. If it looks good on the screen in front of you, it’ll get you that much closer to making it readable on your website.</p>
<h3>Danger, Will Robinson!</h3>
<p>There can be too much of a good thing, of course, particularly if you over-bold, over-italicize, and over-underline (“over-underline”?). If you feature more than one callout on a page, you risk over-emphasizing and trivializing instead.</p>
<h3>Don’t forget to back up your beauty.</h3>
<p>Making your words pretty on the page (or screen) can seduce people into reading about your organization. So once you’ve gotten their eyes, make sure your words are substantive enough to capture their hearts, too. Speak to them clearly and concisely, without condescension or cliché, and tell them all why your work changes the world.</p>
<p>When beauty comes with smarts, my nonprofit friends, the result is irresistible.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1","","","","","Duck-Pond","DuckPond","",

<p>One other change is that nonprofits use RFPs (requests for proposals) more than ever as part of the process of determining which vendors or partners they’ll hire. RFPs can help you gather information about a lot of different possible vendors or partners in one fell swoop. That’s the good news. But there’s also a dark side…</p>
<h3>The dark side of RFPs</h3>
<p>Before you dive into your next RFP process, consider these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to write a good RFP. Most organizations omit critical details, and most of the people you send it to will call you anyway to ask questions.</li>
<li>Most candidates will need a minimum of two weeks, often times a month, to respond thoughtfully.</li>
<li>You can’t judge personal chemistry on paper. Often, the best fit will be the people who really understand your issue and connect with you. Chemistry is something you pick up on through conversation — not in writing.</li>
<li>Beware of the fancy response. The best candidates may also be the busiest — and that means they’re more likely to give you the least impressive proposals.</li>
<li>There’s no such thing as apples to apples. For every scope of work, there are lots of possible approaches and skill sets. The fees, process and variables respondents outline will almost always differ, making it harder for you to compare them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A better, stronger, faster approach</h3>
<p>If you don’t have to issue an RFP, consider this approach instead. You’ll be able to complete it faster, and with better results.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Week One:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of possible candidates. Call your peers or organizations you admire for recommendations. Conduct web searches. Ask your trusted advisors and colleagues.</li>
<li>Start a list of the qualifications you’re hoping to find in an ideal relationship.</li>
<li>Visit the websites of all possible candidates. Make notes: what do they seem to do well? What questions pop up? What will you need them to deliver for you? This will not only help you narrow the playing field, it will help you clarify what you do/don’t need.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Week Two:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Call the candidates that seem viable. Outline your needs and ask them about their capabilities. If they’re experienced, they should give you a sense of how long their work will take, what it might cost, and other nitty-gritty variables. By the end of these calls, you’ll be able to eliminate most and get a sense of which are the real contenders. Candidates who aren’t a fit might even help you find others who are. Don’t be afraid to have frank conversations about your mutual needs, pricing and goals at this stage; this is a bit like speed-dating.</li>
<li>Create a short list. Reflecting on your review of websites, the conversations you’ve had, and your list of requirements, define a short list of two-four candidates. It’s helpful if you can define why you like each one what your concerns are about them at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Week Three:</h3>
<ul>
<li>With your decision-making colleagues, visit the folks on your short list. If you’re looking for a long-term partner or hiring a team (for instance, an agency — not a freelancer), seeing them on their own turf will give you a truer sense of who and what you might actually be hiring. Try to meet everyone on the team you’d be working with, not just people in sales-related roles. You’ll leave with a taste in your mouth you can discuss with your colleagues.</li>
<li>Lastly, if the best candidate still isn’t clear, ask the folks on your short list to write a proposal. This will give you one final way to assess them, and they’ll have talked with you so much you shouldn’t have to issue a formal RFP. If it is clear who the best fit is, ask them to write a contract so you can get all the details in writing before you officially select them: it’s better to be sure you’ll move forward before you let the other options go.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process outlined here typically takes roughly one month, start to finish, if you block out time on your schedule in advance. That’s about twice as fast as a typical RFP process — which requires getting sign-off for the RFP you write, waiting two-four weeks for responses from vendors, reviewing proposals, then meeting with finalists. Instead of spending your time writing and reading, you spend it talking with people, visiting interesting places, and getting a more dimensional sense of your options. You might even come up with a new approach to the project along the way.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1067%1","","","","","Duck-Pond","DuckPond","",

There are many components to an effective email, but first things first: start with a good subject line. Next to the sender’s name, the subject line is the deciding factor in whether or not your supporters will open your message.</p>
<p>Everyone’s emailing these days — your favorite shoe store, your local farmer, your doctor, your school, even your parents. And as the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.e-benchmarksstudy.com/2009.html"" target=""_blank"">2009 eNonprofit Benchmarks Study</a>&nbsp;by M+R Strategic Services and NTEN shows, it’s becoming harder and harder to get your audiences to pay attention as their inbox traffic increases. According to their research, open and click-through rates, which measure how many of your recipients open and/or engage with the content of your emails, both declined from 2007 to 2008.</p>
<p>So put those subject lines to work, and give your emails a chance to stand out from the crowd. Here are a few tips below to help you get more opens (and hopefully clicks).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it short.</strong>&nbsp;Shoot for 30-40 characters (5-8 words), and limit yourself to no more than 60 characters (10-12 words). Some email programs cut off longer subject lines, so your message may get lost.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on your audience.</strong> “We need your donations today!” may sound compelling to you, but what’s in it for your recipients? Put yourself in their shoes, and use your subject line to explain why opening this email will be worth their while. The Obama campaign did a great job with this, using subject lines like, “Will you join me on Election Night?” and “Our message of change.”</li>
<li><strong>Avoid vague/unnecessary phrases.</strong>&nbsp;Subject lines like “July 2009 Enewsletter Volume 12” make our heads spin. First, stating the month is redundant, since there’s a time stamp on every email. Second, and more important, your recipient has no hint as to what’s inside; no invitation to learn more or take action. If you find that your constituents prefer a clue that this is your newsletter, try using a short, consistent intro, like “eNews: Save the world with a click.”</li>
<li><strong>Get to the point quickly.</strong>&nbsp;Online audiences are experts at skimming, so if you don’t catch their eye in the first few words, you may miss your chance. Put important information — like “Last chance” or “Act now” — right up front.</li>
<li><strong>Identify yourself.</strong>&nbsp;If your recipients don’t recognize that the email is from your organization, you may lose the battle with the “delete” button. Here’s where the sender’s name can work in harmony with your subject line. Use your organization’s name (e.g. “Big Duck”) as the sender to save room in the subject line for more interesting content. But if you want to use an individual’s name as the sender for a more personal touch, make sure the individual is well-known in your community or include your organization’s name in the subject line.</li>
<li><strong>Test and test again.</strong>&nbsp;What works for one organization may not work for you. The only way to find out what works for your list is to test. Try different subject lines, and perhaps even senders, and see which ones get the most attention and prompt the greatest response.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, there are many aspects of your email that work together to make your communications effective, including the deliverability of your messages, the content, the design, the calls-to-act or -donate, and more. But a good subject line is a good place to start. It’s like the “teaser” on the outside of a direct-mail envelope.</p>
<p>There’s no sure-fire formula for a perfect subject line. The bottom line: if you keep your audiences’ needs in mind and tell them what to expect, your emails will get the attention they deserve.</p>

<p>Maybe your organization is a social media superstar, or maybe you’re still afraid to get your feet wet (check out Farra’s post on Big Duck’s blog about different attitudes toward social media in the nonprofit world). In any case, it’s likely time to develop a policy around your organization’s use (or non-use) of social media. Here are some things it might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recap of your social media strategy.</strong>&nbsp;What are your goals? Are you trying to raise visibility or new dollars; further your mission; engage staff? Think about which of your audiences you want to connect with (or may already be connecting with) through social media. Consider the tone you want to use or what your organization’s voice will be.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wearemedia.org/Strategy+Track+Module+1"" target=""_blank"">Get started with NTEN’s We Are Media project</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Share guidelines for how staff should “listen and respond.”</strong>&nbsp;Make note of the terms you have set for&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/alerts"" target=""_blank"">Google Alerts</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href=""http://tweetbeep.com/"" target=""_blank"">TweetBeep</a>&nbsp;notifications (for Twitter). Note the staff members that check your Facebook page and blog for comments and discussions — and how often they do. Explain how compelling stories are shared and who responds to topics or mentions. How will you handle critical or otherwise unwelcome comments? Remember — it is not just about posting content, but taking the time to monitor, comment back to any responses, and to share with friends and like-minded organizations.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.webinknow.com/2008/12/the-us-air-force-armed-with-social-media.html"" target=""_blank"">Check out this now famous example of assessing blog comments from the Air Force</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Consider how often and in what ways to use each tool.</strong> Which tools help you build relationships and meet your audience’s needs (not just yours)? Provide suggestions for how your organization might use each tool. For example, how often will you post new content on your Facebook page, update your Facebook status, respond to comments on your wall, send an announcement to Fans or Causes Supporters? Are there any suggestions for who to follow or block on Twitter? (<a href=""http://mashable.com/guidebook/twitter/"" target=""_blank"">Speaking of Twitter, check out this handy Twitter Guide Book from the good folks at Mashable</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Think about how employees represent your organization.</strong> Are there any times when your staff should disclaim their own opinion versus those of the organization? It is important to be yourself in social media and common sense dictates how one might interact. The American Red Cross suggests that staff are “transparent, ethical and accurate” on all personal sites and blogs.&nbsp;<a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/wharman/social-media-strategy-handbook"" target=""_blank"">They have set online communications guidelines for national and local affiliates that echo the organization’s values and mission</a>.

<p><em>What’s the difference? How do we use them? Why do we need them?</em></p>
<h3>Vision Statement</h3>
<p>A Vision Statement articulates the ultimate change your organization wants to make in the world. It paints a picture of the future, often idealistic and motivating. What would the world look like if your organization (and all of the organizations working on the same issue) were to achieve its overarching impact on society?</p>
<p>Vision Statements are often bold and audacious. Go for it. Large, seemingly unrealistic claims are encouraged. That’s what makes them visionary. “We envision a world without poverty” could be a part of a Vision Statement.</p>
<p>A Vision Statement can be a helpful guide for decision-making. Although it might appear in some publications (in an “About your organization” section on your website and/or in a special donor piece), it is not generally used as prominently as your Mission Statement.</p>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>If you think of your Vision Statement as describing the big picture of your work (the whole pie, as it were), the Mission Statement defines your slice of it, your organization’s actual purpose. It explains what your organization does and why it exists.</p>
<p>The Mission Statement usually appears frequently — on the website, in marketing collateral, on grants, etc.</p>
<p>Developing a Mission Statement is a particular challenge because you want to inspire your participants and donors while also offering a concise “nuts and bolts” explanation of what you do.</p>
<h3>Values</h3>
<p>A Values Statement speaks to the philosophy that lies at the heart of your work. It articulates the key beliefs that guide your major programs as well as day-to-day decision-making.</p>
<p>Not every organization feels the need to create a Values Statement. It’s been our experience, however, that every organization that clearly defines its Values ultimate finds them beneficial. Values can motivate and inspire existing and potential staff and board members (“Yes, this is an organization I want to be a part of!”), and they can serve as a public declaration of what your organization stands for and wants evident in, and reflected by, its activities.</p>
<p>Some organizations publish their Values in all materials; others use them more selectively.</p>
<h3>Developing Vision, Mission and Values Statements</h3>
<p>Before a well-crafted statement (one you’d want to use verbatim and regularly) can be produced, leadership (chiefly, board and senior staff) should agree on the ideas that will drive them — often through a strategic planning process. Many organizations leap into word-smithing before they’ve agreed on the Vision, Mission, and Values themselves.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1,1066%2,1409%3","","","","our-mission-vision-no-our-values-wait-what","","","",

<p>But what if your mission doesn’t naturally lend itself to easier, lower-rung engagement opportunities? How do keep your ladder of engagement from becoming one intimidating high bar?</p>
<p>Never fear, here are some ideas and inspiration for adding compelling first steps to your ladder of engagement, no matter what your mission is.</p>
<p><strong>First rung: Get their attention, usually by getting them on your list.</strong> At least twice a year, give people an easy, quick way to take action. The trick here is to make it feel both easy and meaningful—either because the action has a clear impact (yup, this is where online advocacy is helpful) or a clear value, like the potential to lead to interesting information, answers, or just a heartfelt way to express your dedication.</p>
<p>In any of these options, make sure you get the most out of it by capturing a small amount of contact information from anyone who takes action, so you can stay in touch. (An email address, a “like” on Facebook, an address, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some examples I’ve found inspiring: The Smithsonian’s monthly “<a href=""http://www.smarterthanacurator.org/"" target=""_blank"">Are you as Smart as a Curator?</a>” quiz and Fountain House’s <a href=""http://fountainhouse.org/unity/signatures/thank_you"" target=""_blank"">open letter supporting young people with mental illness</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second rung: Stay in touch, become top-of-mind.</strong> Once someone is on your list, it will take a while for your organization to become familiar and top-of-mind. If you give them regular ways to see and hear from you, though, they’ll be primed and ready to act when your next fundraising appeal rolls around.</p>
<p>And no, you don’t have to stay in touch with a big behemoth of a monthly e-newsletter. Try shorter monthly or weekly communications via email, social media, or good old-fashioned snail mail. Just make sure your regular communication offers some way to take action again and gives content your audience will value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some inspiration: <a href=""http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5b63a0823e3b9c105434c46d7&amp;id=d5e2a3cdfe&amp;e=c144a601e0"" target=""_blank"">Daily Good’s daily email</a> highlighting projects or campaigns they feel are making the world a better place. And, just ‘cause I can’t help but brag about my fellow Ducks, <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/tag/262"" target=""_blank"">Meghan’s Weekly Roundup</a> of nonprofit communications links on our blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third rung:</strong> Get them to go public with their support. Any time you give people a way to take action or use your resources, make sure you encourage them to follow up that action by telling their friends or going public with their support. “Share” links and tell-a-friend emails are great ways to do this, but we’ve seen plenty of innovative share graphics on Facebook, and you could consider printed shareables as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some examples: HRC’s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151530218023281&amp;set=a.10150307206218281.358630.18813753280&amp;type=1"" target=""_blank"">use of Facebook share graphics</a> that let “likers” go public with their support of LGBTQ equality and the “Challenge a friend” prompt after the NHS’s “<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/actfast/Pages/know-the-signs.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Act FAST</a>” stroke awareness campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fourth rung: Get them to make their first donation. Once someone has joined your list and taken action, getting them to give a first gift is probably your biggest benchmark of success. A welcome series of emails that ends with an appeal is a tried and true way to work new list members up to donating, but there are lots of other ways to target your most promising prospects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some creative tactics: Ask first-time donors to make a very low-level gift of a specific or symbolic amount (Like Create Jobs for USA’s <a href=""https://createjobsforusa.org/"" target=""_blank"">“Indivisible” wristband $5</a> ask or the Bronx Zoo’s Valentine’s Day <a href=""http://www.bronxzoo.com/roach/"" target=""_blank"">Name a Roach</a> for $10 campaign. (That last one is totally worth checking out, trust us.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fifth rung: Get them to give more… or monthly! If a segment of your list has given before, they’ve already proven their dedication, so be sure to avoid under-asking!</p>
<p>Ask these donors for at least as much as they’ve previously given, or encourage them to take the next step and become monthly givers. Segmentation is your friend here—break out these donors and try some creative tactics to get them onto those highest rungs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some interesting examples: When donors gave to the Obama campaign in last year’s election, they got a follow-up request to chip in a small additional amount soon after. And we’ve also seen several organizations try following up to recent donors a month after their gift, encouraging them to give a fraction of that amount monthly.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just to think, that’s only the beginning!</p>
<p>How are you getting creative to engage supporters across different rungs of the ladder? We’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!</p>

<p>Little known fact: I’m kind of a science geek (thanks to Mr. Hill, the physics teacher of destiny). I’m also a public radio geek (thanks to the dear old BBC). Put those two together and you get a big fan of <a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/"" target=""_blank"">Radio Lab</a>.</p>

In the context of comparing an ad campaign for a nonprofit science and technology center in Canada to science journalism, he says:</p>
<p>“We who are doing this, we reporters, we animators, we science teachers, we bloggers, we artists, we museum managers, we research scientists, we copywriters — we don't do what we do to speak to the Already Informed. We are doing this to tap ordinary, everyday people on their heads, people who might not have the time or the inclination, and say to them, ""spend a few minutes over here, mulling this ...""</p>
<p>Sound familiar? That’s because that’s our job as nonprofit communicators, too: to tap on the shoulder ordinary, everyday people who don’t know as much as we do about our organization or issue and say “spend a few minutes over here, mulling this...”</p>
<p>And just like a science journalist it’s also our job as nonprofit communicators to do more than just share all of the geeky detail and “science” involved in the work we do. We have to understand all the complexity of what our organizations do and how they help, filter it to find the most compelling information, and then translate it into laymans terms for your audiences to get excited about.</p>
<p>Not an easy job, but a necessary one. Because if we don’t we’re likely to confuse and intimidate people, just like even the coolest science can confuse and intimate people if it isn’t explained in the right way.</p>
<p>The ad campaign <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/04/10/176796033/is-this-science-journalism-nah-then-what-is-it"" target=""_blank"">that Krulwich mentions</a> does a great job of doing that. It finds a few small sciencey facts that are interesting to pretty much everyone, and uses them to invite people in to learn more about science.</p>

<p>It starts with defining your organization's goals and a sense of the strategies you'll use to achieve them.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that one of your organization's key goals has to do with reaching (and influencing) members of Congress. Does that mean that members of Congress are the primary audience for your communications?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>It depends, of course, but you may decide that in order to reach those members of Congress most effectively, what you need to do is mobilize their constituents. Maybe you would even focus on a specific sub-set of those constituents, who can help organize and motivate their neighbors.</p>
<p>If so, that small group is the primary audience for your communications—the people you need to reach out to directly, inspire to action, and equip to message on your behalf. It's not that members of Congress aren't a part of your plan—far from it. It's just that the message you want to send doesn't reach them through your logo or tagline or even your website: it reaches them through the voices and faces of your supporters. Your strategy (i.e., mobilize grassroots activists) for achieving your goal (i.e., influence members of Congress) determines how you think about your audience for communications.</p>
<p>The same applies if you're considering asking your most enthusiastic supporters to fundraise for you, or making alums a key part of your recruitment cycle.</p>
<p>It sounds obvious, but it can be hard to do in the moment.

Instead of working on the projects she and her staff had planned for, they got sucked into the planning and coordination of an event that an important board member launched at the last minute. When it was over, the event had raised six figures thanks to their efforts, but other fundraising priorities (the ones they’d planned for) had suffered for lack of attention.&nbsp;</p>","<p>A fundraiser friend of mine had an entire month hijacked from her professional life recently. Instead of working on the projects she and her staff had planned for, they got sucked into the planning and coordination of an event that an important board member launched at the last minute. When it was over, the event had raised six figures thanks to their efforts, but other fundraising priorities (the ones they’d planned for) had suffered for lack of attention.&nbsp;</p>
<div>Although the event was an income-producer, it also clearly drained valuable resources. In the end, she found herself wondering how to measure the ROI (return on investment) for the project in a way that might meaningfully account for everything her staff put into it — not just the hard (external) costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ever try to figure out the value of your own time? You might find it useful as you decide which projects to keep in-house, outsource, or discard altogether in 2009 and beyond. Here’s how you do it:</div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Figure out your total cost to the organization. </strong><br />Staff person’s salary + taxes + benefits (insurance, etc) = total cost to organization. If you’re not sure what your benefits are worth or what the organization pays in tax and social security-related overhead, there’s likely someone in your accounting/operations team who can tell you. Ten percent is often a safe ballpark for the taxes your organization pays on top of your salary, but this figure will vary based on where you work. </li>
<li><strong>Figure out how many hours you actually work each year. </strong><br />First, figure out how many weeks you work each year by subtracting the number of vacation and sick days you get plus the number of days your office is closed for holidays from 52. (Most people end up working 40-48 weeks per year). Then, multiply the number of weeks you work against the number of hours you work in a typical week (for most, that’s 40 hours — or 35, if you take a formal lunch hour). If you want to be really accurate, adjust these hours down to reflect your own level of productivity (for instance, if you’d guess you’re actually productive at work 90% of the time, then account for 90% of the hours. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Divide your total cost to the organization into the number of hours you work each year.</strong><br />Although this number won’t be 100% exact, it will give you a relatively accurate sense of what your time costs the organization.  </li>
</ol>
<div>Here's an example: </div>
<div>Sally is paid $65,000 in salary. With benefits (her insurance costs $400 per month, or $4,800 per year) and taxes ($6,500 per year, or 10% of her salary), she costs the organization she works for $76,300 annually. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sally’s company is closed for big holidays like New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving, and a handful of religious and bank holidays — totaling 15 days in a typical year (3 weeks). In addition to those holidays, Sally gets 3 weeks of paid vacation, and another 5 sick or personal days — so her total number of working weeks is generally 45 per year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She works, on average, a 40-hour week. Forty hours per week x 45 weeks = 1800 hours worked over the course of a year. She figures she’s productive about 85% of the time, which brings her number of productive work hours down to 1530 per year. When we divide 1530 into $76,300, we get an hourly cost of $49.87 to the nonprofit Sally works for. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you plan ahead, consider the value of your time — and that of your staff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Using these figures in spreadsheets that calculate income versus expenses to determine return on investment can be particularly useful. When my fundraising friend did, she found that, despite the event’s income generation, the net was significantly lower than the organization hoped, and the value of her staff’s time might have generated more income for the organization overall if they’d worked on other projects. These calculations may prove handy when deciding which projects to maintain and which to cut.</div>

Most of the nonprofits we’ve spoken with recently have reported organization-wide budget cuts to the tune of 10–25 percent.</p>","<p>If your organization’s communications and/or development budget got cut at the end of 2008, you’re not alone. Most of the nonprofits we’ve spoken with recently have reported organization-wide budget cuts to the tune of 10–25 percent.</p>
<p>In a recession, reminding donors why they support you, inspiring their ongoing commitment, saying thank you, and demonstrating your value to new and old supporters is more critical than ever. Here are a few realistic ways any member of your staff can help your development team address that gap in your budget.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weave one big, overarching idea or theme into all of your communications.</strong>&nbsp;Ideally, this theme speaks your audiences’ language — not your own organizational jargon. It’s passionate, creative, compelling, and demonstrates the best of your organization. Independent Sector’smembership brochure, created by Big Duck in 2008, uses “Together, We Can” to tell several stories of what happens when nonprofits work together to change the sector and the world. If your leadership or communications team develops a concept and then shows each department how to use it, you’ll find it’s much easier to get everyone singing from the same songbook. Another powerful example is United Way’s new campaign,&nbsp;<a href=""http://liveunited.org/"" target=""_blank"">Live United</a>, which helps national and local chapters speak with one voice and motivates Americans to give, advocate, and volunteer in their community.</li>
<li><strong>Segment and cultivate online.</strong>&nbsp;It’s expensive and time-consuming to truly personalize your communications with lapsed donors, mid-level sustainers, or newer, smaller donors. On the other hand, one-size-fits-all communications, while often more affordable, miss a critical opportunity to help donors feel you understand their point of view. If you’ve got an email list and a strong story to tell, social media (Facebook, blogs, podcasts, your own social networking site, etc.) make it easier to start a real dialogue with donors and engage them on their own terms. Take a look at how Big Duck developed ‘parent projects’ — special fundraising initiatives sponsored by parents — to encourage targeted year-end gifts online for these useful guidelines for optimizing your online donations (thanks, Guidestar and DonorDigital!) for a few useful tips.</li>
<li>Lastly, if you aren’t doing so already,<strong>&nbsp;start capturing email addresses and mobile phone numbers.</strong> Ask for both on business reply envelopes (BREs), online forms, intake paperwork, and wherever else you capture information. You may not be ready to leverage them now, but you’ll want to have a list in place when the time is right.</li>

In this unstable economy, many organizations are attempting to do the same: trying to predict what donors will do with no or little advance warning.</p>","<p>With a tighter budget and no clear timeline for when things will improve, fundraisers and communicators are scrambling to prioritize and invest prudently. Much has already been written on this subject, but if you can’t stay on top of it all, we recommend the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.theagitator.net/"" target=""_blank"">Agitator blog</a>&nbsp;as a down-and-dirty way to follow fundraising data and trends. Direct mail guru Mal Warwick also recently released an interesting report called&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.malwarwick.com/learning-resources/articles.html"" target=""_blank"">Fundraising in Tough Times</a>, which plays out three possible scenarios for economic recovery, and then relates each to actions you can take in your direct mail efforts.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""/clients"">nonprofits we Ducks work with</a>&nbsp;are taking a few different approaches, depending on</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How strong their brands are.<br /></strong>Those with weak visual identities and messaging platforms are shoring them up to make a more concise, articulate, competitive case.</li>
<li><strong>How strong their websites are.</strong><br />Those who can are investing in web 2.0, migrating away from printing too many materials and communicating more frequently at less cost via email, websites, and social media. This strategy helps when you have a strong brand in place, but can fail if the messages and visuals are scattered and inconsistent, or if your audiences aren’t interested in communicating with you through these tools.</li>
<li><strong>How current their direct marketing/individual donor fundraising programs are.</strong> <br />Many large organizations with well-oiled direct mail machines are shifting away from traditional packages toward more segmented approaches with big online components. Integrated campaigns with social media, email, and other elements are becoming more standard, as they allow more communication with less expense, assuming your audiences are online.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, there’s no easy answer here, and certainly no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. In addition to scaling back on newer projects and overall belt-tightening, most organizations seem to be revisiting their core strengths and what makes them unique/different. What inspired your earliest supporters to give? What channels have always been tried and true? Where’s the low-hanging fruit? After the panic subsides, how prepared will your organization be for what’s coming next?</p>
<p>From a communications point of view, we Ducks believe it’s time to focus on the basics: strengthen your weakest areas, invest in the communications that offer the biggest bang for the buck, listen and talk to your most passionate supporters, and stay true to your mission as you weather the storm.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1067%1","","","","","Duck-Pond","DuckPond","",

It starts with the core purpose and vision your organization hopes to fulfill and goes all the way through how people experience your organization—via programs, events, videos, newsletters, and yes, your website.</span></p>","<p>Your organization’s brand is more than just its logo, its name, or how it all looks on letterhead. It starts with the core purpose and vision your organization hopes to fulfill and goes all the way through how people experience your organization—via programs, events, videos, newsletters, and yes, your website.</p>
<p>If you had to describe your organization in a single word or idea, what would it be? What about your personality? Are you more professional and academic; hip and cutting-edge; or grassroots and responsive? Now, keep that idea and those adjectives in mind, and take a fresh look at your website…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the single idea that you want people to associate with your organization immediately apparent?</li>
<li>Does the general design of the site—including navigation, colors, content, and features—reflect the personality you want participants, donors, and advocates to associate with you?</li>
<li>Did you develop your website with these audiences in mind? Do you involve them in the ongoing operation of your organization’s website in any way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many nonprofits invest in a logo design and messaging work and strive to communicate their organization's brand consistently, with varying degrees of success. Although your website is only one application of your brand, it is one you must pay increasing attention to. Your website represents your organization 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. People trying to get help or information will come visit your site from work, from home, from the library, even from their phones day and night. If they can’t find what they need from your site immediately, they’ll go elsewhere, and you may have lost them forever.</p>
<p>In addition to helping those looking for services, your site needs to answer existing and potential donors’ questions. In this tough economy, donors are being even more critical of how their dollars are being spent. Presenting your work in a credible and engaging way—through design, copy, structure, and interactive functionality—reassures donors of their investment.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple things you can do to improve the experience of your brand through your website.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look at your domain name.</strong> Is your URL an acronym that only insiders have any real connection to? OR is it so long that people easily misspell or forget it? Having a URL that is easy to remember and also contains some of your target keywords helps for marketing and search engine placement, but it’s important to look at it from all angles. Your organization thought hard about its name, so apply some of the same questions to your domain name. And once you come up with some ideas, reserve them soon—before someone else does.</li>
<li><strong>Compare your website to other materials.</strong> At the next staff meeting, place examples of the past two years’ worth of communications on the table—newsletters, annual reports, appeals, etc. Then pull up your organization’s website, e-newsletters, and online appeals on a computer monitor. How do they all look together? Does the same feel and message immediately come across or does it feel like you are looking at the work of two (or more) different organizations?</li>
<li><strong>Ask how you are doing.</strong> Whether you are trying to reach program participants, volunteers, activists, donors, funders, members of the media, policymakers, or all of the above through your site, how do you measure that success? Here are a few simple things you can do to make sure your website and other online communications are audience-centric:</li>
<ol>
<li>Review users’ comments sent via email or posted on blogs;</li>
<li>Ask staff for feedback;</li>
<li>Review website statistics for popular pages, time spent on site, top keywords from search engines, and other metrics;</li>
<li>Conduct surveys and ask direct questions about content and features;</li>
<li>Develop user personas to help you structure and design a site built around user needs and interests;</li>
<li>Conduct user testing with five-to-eight real users to test actual scenarios and see if these users can find the content they seek and you want to deliver;</li>
<li>Facilitate focus groups to help determine the direction of new designs or features.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>Your website is a vital tool for communicating your brand, whether setting your organization apart from peers and competitors, expressing your personality, or simply showing how you keep users’ needs in mind as they browse.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1067%1","","","","","Duck-Pond","DuckPond","",

<h3>Here are a few of our takeaways:</h3>
<h3 class=""alt"">Yes, Virginia, integration is the magic word.</h3>
<p>You’ve heard it before, but it’s true. Although it may seem neater and easier to separate your direct mail revenue from your email or telemarketing income, department silos don’t motivate your donors to give. Donors support your organization because of its mission — and they want to give when and how it’s convenient for them. Make it easy, ask across channels, and focus on the message — not the budget line. Some of the most successful organizations have combined their offline and online fundraising departments and use a calendar to coordinate communication. They’ve even created integrated campaigns with advocacy, programs, AND fundraising goals. How’s that for breaking down barriers?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">The Internet has evolved from a source of information to a place of coordination.</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.shirky.com/"" target=""_blank"">Clay Shirky, author of Here Comes Everybody</a>, delivered a provocative keynote offering a few sharp insights into organizing without organizations. He reminded us that it is not about the media; it is about the audience. Instead of asking if your organization should set up a&nbsp;<a href=""http://twitter.com/"" target=""_blank"">Twitter account</a>, ask what’s unique about the information you might “tweet” and if your audience is likely to listen (or in Twitterspeak, “follow"").</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">23-year-olds in the senior staff meeting? Sure!</h3>
<p>People using new media effectively to spark action (um, like our President) know that the Internet is a game-changer. Instead of pursuing the usual outreach and fundraising strategies and trying to figure out how to add Internet to the mix, they’re restructuring from the inside out. The web team participates in senior programs, development, and organizational meetings now, and not just to add that vibrant spark of youth and disheveled hair — they’re looking for ways to integrate new media into accomplishing real objectives.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Worried about losing control? You already have.</h3>
<p>Thanks to the Internet, everyone is a publisher. Clay suggested a simple exercise: search your organization’s name in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/"" target=""_blank"">Google</a>, and exclude all pages from your site in the results. Did you know about all these mentions? And what about social networking sites? Just because your organization hasn’t set up a profile on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/home.php"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>&nbsp;yet, doesn’t mean you’re not there. An enthusiastic volunteer may be posting links to your site on their wall or even setting up a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/causes"" target=""_blank"">Causes</a>&nbsp;page for you. When this happens, don’t call your lawyer, contact the person who did it. Befriend them and tap into their passion.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Looking for new donors? Try saying thank you.</h3>
<p>More and more organizations are using the thank you page (for email sign-ups, action alerts, publication downloads, etc.) to thank visitors (of course) and invite them to donate to the organization. And while you are at it, when you ask people to do something, explain what happens next. If you ask people to share their story, tell them how you will use it. If you ask them to donate, explain how the funds will be used.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">If you want to grow your list, start with people you’ve already got.</h3>
<p>Your donors want to do more than write a check; they want to do something. Some of them even want to raise money for you. Social fundraising (think&nbsp;<a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/causes/birthdays/62917"" target=""_blank"">Causes’ Birthday Wishes</a>&nbsp;or Sponsor Me for a Race/Walk/Run pages) are great ways to transform your activists into donors and fundraisers. The keys to this newer form of fundraising involve personal relationships, demonstrating impact, taking collective action, and offering social recognition. While the donors to these campaigns may be easy to get, they are hard to keep. Be sure to start — and follow-through — on a strategy to cultivate and steward these donors.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Beware of the shiny new toy syndrome.</h3>
<p>In the flurry of social media hype, don’t forget about your website. Your website is still “home” to many in your community — and to some, your website may be the only way they know you. What does your website say about you? Can program participants find the information they seek? Does the content welcome and inspire donors? Are activists given the tools they need to change policies, behaviors, and attitudes? Should you want to dive into the social media pool, focus on where the people are… and where you can be most effective.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Search engine optimization may not be sexy, but it is still important.</h3>
<p>Sure you’ve got loyal visitors who have your site bookmarked or even set as their homepage. But are you doing all that you can to help new audiences find you in search engines? And about those that do come to your site… do you know how they got there? We heard several comments from people who’ve set up tracking tools like&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/analytics/"" target=""_blank"">Google Analytics</a>&nbsp;but rarely check them or know how to interpret the rich data.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Need to convince your boss? Follow your peers.</h3>
<p>Does your executive director want to publish a really long e-newsletter every week? Does she want to make sure five people in your organization have reviewed any posts to the blog before they are posted? The best way to persuade the boss who doesn’t quite get this 2.0 stuff is to show what your peers are doing. Take a look at other orgs who do similar work and presumably attract some of the same supporters and participants. What do they do? Sometimes competition breeds the best creativity.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Of course, just because something works for one organization, doesn’t mean it will work for yours.</h3>
<p>In one session we heard two case studies of testing the use of premiums (you know, scarves, tote bags, and other SWAG) to convert e-news readers to donors. For one organization, the results were stellar — but for another, they had a negative impact. If you are thinking of trying something new, start with a small test before you roll it out.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Speaking of testing, the more you test, the more you know.</h3>
<p>To get test results that are statistically significant, you’ll need email lists and website visitors in the tens of thousands. Don’t have that? Don’t fret. There’s still much you can learn from testing. Some great advice we heard: Know what you want to learn, how you will use it, and what you will do (or stop doing) afterwards. Start by testing simple things — perhaps it’s the tone of intro copy, the color of the donate button on your site, who signs emails, the length of subject lines, or the images you use in messages.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">(Charismatic personality + adoring fans) x public humiliation = fundraising genius.</h3>
<p>NTEN’s executive director, Holly Ross, aimed to raise $10,000 to provide scholarships for people to attend the NTC conference. To raise the funds, which would then be matched by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.convio.com/"" target=""_blank"">Convio</a>, Holly enticed would-be donors with the promise of utter embarrassment. All those who donated would be able to vote on something Holly might do during the conference keynote — playing the trombone, remaking Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” video, or eating large masses of bacon. The funds were raised and the stakes were set.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nten.org/blog/2009/04/27/hollys-remake-beyonces-single-ladies"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a>&nbsp;to watch Holly’s version of “Single Ladies”… Even if you don’t know her, we bet you’ll be entertained.</p>

That number seems astounding at first — but when you start it break it down, it really isn’t surprising at all.</p>","<p>About a decade ago, a number of studies concluded that the average American receives somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 marketing messages every day. That number seems astounding at first — but when you start it break it down, it really isn’t surprising at all. Think, for a minute, about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many ads you are exposed to daily through television, newspapers, magazines and radio</li>
<li>How many marketing messages you receive online through email, banner ads, or social media</li>
<li>How many ads you see or hear in transit as you drive, walk, or use public transportation</li>
<li>How many ‘asks’ you get in the mail- from organizations, businesses, and retailers</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all of this marketing exposure, we’re also processing what we receive through the various channels we use to communicate personally and professionally. A decade ago, you probably conducted the majority of your communications with others face-to-face or by phone. These days, we communicate through email, phone, PDA, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.</p>
<p>Unless you’re superhuman, chances are good you’re spending most of your time triaging, skimming and ignoring. You couldn’t possibly read every communication you get carefully and respond thoughtfully, right? (It’s frightening if you imagine what it might be like for major donors.)</p>
<p>In the midst of all of this noise, we still regularly hear these words uttered by nonprofit staffers:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We can’t use this same piece over again!”</li>
<li>“If we ask our donors more than once a year, they’ll think we’re being too aggressive”</li>
<li>“Our board wants us to get a story written about us in (insert prestigious news source here), because that’ll bring in donations.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to let go of these myths and change your thinking so you can cut through the clutter.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Repetition is a good thing</h3>
<p>“Effective Frequency” is a term coined decades ago that describes how many times an individual needs to receive a marketing message before it actually registers. This rule explains why you see the same car commercial over and over and over again as you watch an hour-long episode of tv. As much as we’d like to think each donor actually read your last annual report cover-to-cover, chances are they didn’t- most skimmed it and threw it away quickly. Updating the financials and using the same piece again this year can be a great way to conserve resources in lean years.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Talk with me, don’t nag me</h3>
<p>If all of the communicating you do with donors is focused on asking them to make gifts, it’s true they won’t want to hear from you very often. (Who wants to get a call from the relative who only calls to ask for money??)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re sharing news and providing ways for them to participate in your community or take (non-giving) action regularly, they’ll be fine with more frequent asks. Social media and regular (digital) e-news can help donors stay connected all year long.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Major coverage is as good as what you do with it</h3>
<p>Every day, nonprofits get front-page mention in major newspapers, long clips on CNN, stories in must-read blogs, and other to-die-for media coverage. This coverage typically results in a blip in web traffic and, if the organization is lucky, a handful of inquiries or donations. With so many ways to watch and read it seems fewer and fewer people do so carefully- or perhaps they’re (we’re!) just too busy to take action after we see something compelling.</p>
<p>The organizations that use media coverage well know that the true value of these stories is often in what you do with it afterwards– for instance, by sending reprints with a hand-written note to major donors and board members.</p>
<p>While there are exceptions, most organizations can no longer count on the story alone to raise visibility and bring in gifts- so invest cautiously in chasing media coverage and wisely in using it after the fact.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">It all comes back to strategy</h3>
<p>Rather than communicate sporadically and reactively, focus your limited staff and budget in the areas that are most likely to help you make an impact with the people you want to reach.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1","","","","","","","",

<p>Twitter is nonprofit-friendly, too. Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s co-founders, recently announced that they’ll be producing their&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/good-wine-and-books.html"" target=""_blank"">own wine</a>&nbsp;label and sharing the proceeds with Room to Read, a literacy nonprofit. They also agreed to let the owner of the username @Drew auction it off for charity (an exception to the usual rules), and Drew Carey of TV fame is willing to pay up to 1 million dollars to acquire it.</p>
<p>All well and good. But apart from wine and charity auctions, what are the biggest opportunities for nonprofits on Twitter? While Twitter is primarily about sharing and exchanging information, many organizations are using the microblogging service to support fundraising and advocacy campaigns. A recent successful campaign illustrates a lot of important points about what makes Twitter powerful in support of ideas and causes.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a group in Georgia kicked off a&nbsp;<a href=""http://beatcancereverywhere.com/"" target=""_blank"">social media campaign</a>&nbsp;with two goals: set a Guinness World Record for number of social media mentions in a 24-hour period, and raise money for cancer research. In a nonprofit context, the first goal relates to advocacy (raising awareness or inviting action); the second, obviously, to fundraising.</p>
<p>Organizers lined up corporate sponsors to donate a penny every time the phrase “#BeatCancer” was mentioned on Twitter, Facebook, or a blog during the 24-hour period, and identified four nonprofits as the beneficiaries of the donation.</p>
<p>The campaign was a big success. The campaign hashtag was mentioned over 200,000 times, leading to an estimated 100 million impressions. #BeatCancer was a trending topic on Twitter for much of the day. And the organizers raised $70,000 for cancer research.</p>
<p>What can nonprofits learn about running campaigns on Twitter from this successful effort?</p>
<ul>
<li>Real time rules. From launch to completion, the whole #BeatCancer initiative was live for 24 hours. 24 hours! That’s awfully fast. Twitter reaches people wherever they are, and — importantly — whenever they are.</li>
<li>Make it sharable. Raise a penny for cancer, just by typing a word? Who could resist? That irresistibility is what sends an idea or a cause or a meme viral. The idea spread so quickly and so broadly because everyone who heard about the campaign wanted to share it with their friends.</li>
<li>Don’t be demanding. In some ways, this campaign was the epitome of&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism"" target=""_blank"">slactivism</a>: thousands of people helped set a world record and raise thousands of dollars…by typing a word into their web browser. The focus was definitely on quantity over quality. But it was a simple call-to-action, and it inspired hundreds of thousands of people to take part. The more complicated your ask, the harder it will be to gain high-profile exposure (i.e. become a “trending topic”) on Twitter.</li>
<li>Think outside the tweets. #BeatCancer launched at BlogWorld New Media Expo ’09, a huge conference widely attended by social media all-stars. Without that hub of influential Tweeters to kick-start the campaign, who knows whether they would have enjoyed the same level of success. If you set up a Twitter initiative, think about real-world events — like a gala or a conference — you can use to get the ball rolling.</li>
<li>Embrace reductiveness. On Twitter, you only have 140 characters to express yourself — short and sweet is the name of the game. You might argue that the message for #beatcancer was too simple: tweet this phrase. Not “Go here to learn more,” or “Make a donation.” Furthermore, although the money raised benefited a handful of specific organizations, the appeal was generic: “fight cancer,” not “support X organization.” For better or worse, Twitter forces you to keep it simple.</li>
<li>Fundraising is tricky. This campaign raised over $70,000 to fight cancer, but not by appealing to existing individual donors. So far, that’s proved pretty difficult on Twitter. Eventually, as micropayment software makes it easier and easier to make small donations, and donors get more and more comfortable with online giving, it might be a great place to make a fundraising ask. But in the meantime, if you’ve joined Twitter expecting to find a silver fundraising bullet, you’ll probably be disappointed.</li>
<li>It’s early yet. This campaign set the world record for social media mentions, which is an accomplishment. It also serves as a reminder of how far social media outlets like Twitter have to go before they become truly mainstream. 200,000 mentions — it’s a lot, but it’s also a drop in the bucket. For perspective, Facebook has about 250 million active users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Twitter is an exciting tool that offers a lot of opportunities — and a lot of limitations. Before you look to Twitter to support your fundraising and advocacy efforts, think carefully about whether you can make them work in your favor. And don’t forget: managing a campaign like this requires a lot of time as you monitor its progress, respond to direct messages, retweet supporters, and cultivate its growth.</p>
<p>Campaigns aside, if your organization is using Twitter actively, you’ll also need to think about the day-to-day.

Now what do I tweet?”</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1","","","","","Duck-Pond","DuckPond","",

<p></p>","<p>Why is it that start-up businesses always hire experienced marketers, but nonprofits rarely create a high-level communications role until their staff is large or the operating budget is in the millions?</p>
<p>In smaller nonprofits — and in some medium-sized ones — you could take a Rip Van Winkle-sized nap waiting for someone to say that their job description includes communications responsibilities, yet there’s still plenty of external communications going on.</p>
<p>In larger organizations, the front-line communicators are often fundraisers, key programs staff, and the executive director. Their communications goals may not be aligned, and the messages they send out can be confusing and contradictory. And even at large nonprofits there can be a dearth of staff with marketing and communications-related education or experience.</p>
<p>So what’s a worthy nonprofit like yours to do?</p>
<p>Because you’re a loyal reader of the Duck Pond, we hope you’ll join Big Duck’s principal and founder Sarah Durham for a sneak peak into the world of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brandraising-Nonprofits-Visibility-Through-Communications/dp/0470527536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368482043&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brandraising"">Brandraising: How Nonprofits Raise Visibility and Money through Smart Communications</a>. No, this isn’t a some crazy, Brooklyn version of Skull and Bones — it’s Sarah’s forthcoming book. And we’re offering Duck Pond readers the chance to participate in a free webinar about Brandraising and win a copy of the book before it even hits the shelves.</p>
<p>In the free webinar, we’ll cover fun stuff like:</p>

<li>How to avoid getting mired in the trenches of day-to-day communicating and see the long view</li>
<li>What positioning and personality are, and how you can use them</li>
<li>What “branding” really means for a nonprofit, and how your Vision and Mission relate to it</li>

According to the panel, nonprofits most commonly use mobile for three types of communications: fundraising appeals, advocacy alerts, and informational messages (program outreach). Although mobile offers interesting new opportunities in all of these areas, these experts agreed that mobile should support and add to—not replace—other technology or communications channels.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.e-benchmarksstudy.com/mobile/"" target=""_blank"">2010 Nonprofit Text Messaging Benchmark Study</a>, mobile is still in the experimental phase for most nonprofits, with only a few that have been at it for more than a year. The study’s six national organizations are getting cell phone numbers from their existing lists of contacts. The study also found that text messages connected to advocacy campaigns tend to generate the greatest rate of response, as texting signals urgency and importance. Response rates for alerts to call policymakers were six times higher by SMS than by email.</p>

<p>Never fear: help has arrived!</p>
<p>Today we’re launching a very new, very free companion to Sarah Durham’s book,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brandraising-Nonprofits-Visibility-Through-Communications/dp/0470527536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263236093&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising: How Nonprofits Raise Visibility and Money Through Smart Communications</a>&nbsp;(amazon affiliate link).

Just visit<a href=""http://bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard"" target=""_blank"">bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard</a>&nbsp;to get started.</p>
<p>Completing the questionnaire will take about 15 minutes, and then the little ducks inside the computer will generate a report that details how your communications efforts stack up. It’s also got a<a href=""/resources/scorecard/glossary"">glossary</a>&nbsp;to help you with any unfamiliar terms, and advice to help you improve your nonprofit’s communications, all customized based on your answers. (How sweet is that?)</p>
<p>Plus, if you take the scorecard before Tuesday, November 9, you will be entered to win a copy of Brandraising.</p>
<h3>But will they ever change?</h3>
<p>We know: you’re game to try the brandraising scorecard and might even be willing to make some changes. But will others on your leadership team feel the same way? First, try taking it yourself and see what you get out of it. Don’t hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:scorecard@bigducknyc.com?subject=About%20this%20brandraising%20scorecard%20of%20yours..."">let us know</a>&nbsp;what you think: we’re looking for input and will make improvements along the way.</p>
<p>To start a bigger conversation, try asking a few key people on your team to complete the scorecard too. Carve out an hour to talk through the results each of you gets, without pushing any particular agenda. That conversation might spark some serious change.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to hearing what you think about the scorecard and your results! Keep your eyes peeled on the Duck Call blog too, as we’ll be posting updates, results, and other scorecard-related news there henceforth.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1","","","","whats-your-brandraising-score","Duck-Pond Brandraising","DuckPond","",

<li>Of course, you could avoid using words altogether and think about&nbsp;<a href=""/picture-s-worth-1000-words-information-graphics-nonprofits"">ways to&nbsp;use infographics in your nonprofit’s communications</a>. As&nbsp;<a href=""/rebecca-hume"">Rebecca</a>&nbsp;points out, a good infographic can illustrate ideas that might otherwise take pages to explain in writing.</li>
<li>Ever wondered&nbsp;<a href=""/who-should-manage-communications-your-nonprofit"">who should manage communications at your nonprofit</a>? Should it be the development department or the communications department? Sarah explains why that question might not be as important as asking what your organization’s culture is around communication.</li>
<li>And finally, looking to the future…&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Mobile-Access-2010.aspx"" target=""_blank"">more and more people are using their cell phones to access the internet, buy things, and have fun</a>.

</ul>
<p>This doesn’t cover everything you might need to consider when planning your communications for 2011—each nonprofit’s communications needs are different. But we hope it gets you thinking about how to further your communications and help kick-start a great new year for your organization.</p>

With the rising use of social media, the lines between our professional and personal presence are blurring and blending.</p>
<p>So how can you make sure your social media presence is benefiting both your organization and yourself? Here are ten steps to get you started…</p>
<p>1. Decide your goals for communicating in social media. Consider your personal goals and those of the organization you work for. Where do these goals meet and how do they differ? For example, say one of your organization’s goals is to connect to donors using social media and one of your own goals is to be seen as a seasoned fundraising professional. As a staff person, you might update your Facebook status or tweet about how passionate you are about the issue and offer ways people can donate. Perhaps you could even&nbsp;<a href=""http://exchange.causes.com/resources/features/birthday-wish/"" target=""_blank"">donate your birthday</a>&nbsp;to raise funds for your cause.</p>
<p>These efforts could help your contacts connect both to you and the organization, while also demonstrating your understanding about how to use these tools professionally. Of course, your personal goals could be just that. Maybe you want to cook more, so you follow and read blogs and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Tweet-Twitter-Communitys-cookbook/dp/1579654266"" target=""_blank"">updates about new recipes to try</a>.</p>
<p>2. Draft a personal positioning statement for yourself. What is the big idea you want people to associate with you? What should come to mind when they hear or see your name? To answer this, start by thinking about not only how you would describe yourself but also how others describe you too. Google yourself and see what the interwebs have to say about who you are. Now stop and think about how you want the world to see you. What are you passionate about and what makes you unique? Who are the people you are trying to reach?</p>
<p>Get out some paper and a pen and write a personal positioning statement. Try this structure:</p>
<p>I am a ___________ in _________ for __________.</p>

How can your nonprofit choose the ones that will help you reach your audiences without overwhelming you? It’s simple, really—let your brand lead the way.</p>","<p>Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare, Quora…there’s a world of social tools out there. How can your nonprofit choose the ones that will help you reach your audiences without overwhelming you? It’s simple, really—let your brand lead the way.<br /><br />There are two important concepts that provide the foundation for all of your communications efforts: positioning and personality.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard/glossary#Positioning"" target=""_blank"">Positioning</a>&nbsp;is big idea you want people to associate with you, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard/glossary#Personality"" target=""_blank"">personality</a>&nbsp;is the tone/style you use to communicate to guide how your audience experiences you.<br /><br />We Ducks are often asked how&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">brandraising</a>&nbsp;impacts fundraising, social media, and other types of day-to-day communications. So we thought we'd dedicate this issue of the Duck Pond to highlight a recent example.<br /><br />At the end of April,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sco.org/home/sco-competes-for-500000-top-prize/"" target=""_blank"">SCO Family of Services</a>&nbsp;got an opportunity to dive into the deep end of the social media pool. They were one of five nonprofits selected to compete for up $500,000 to support their work with homeless and disconnected youth through an online voting contest sponsored by Lady Gaga and the Robin Hood Foundation.<br /><br />As an essential provider of effective social services for New York City and Long Island, SCO Family of Services has traditionally prioritized direct service delivery over external communications. But they couldn’t miss an opportunity like this.<br /><br /><img alt=""SCO email"" src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/sites/default/files/images/DuckPond/July2011/sco-email.jpg"" align=""left"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 10px;"" hspace=""10"" />Because we previously worked with SCO to update its brand, they came back to Big Duck to figure out how to compete and win the contest. Over an intense two-week period, we used their personality traits—<i>vital</i>,<i>nurturing</i>,&nbsp;<i>expert</i>, and&nbsp;<i>trusted</i>—to guide the strategy, choose the right communications channels,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.marknetmail.com/mx/display.php?M=88824&amp;C=2d96f6ac214a403595aca3e69fa0b5bf&amp;S=1773&amp;L=348&amp;N=1059"" target=""_blank"">craft the copy and design of messages</a>, update the website, and engage new fans and followers on Facebook and Twitter.<br /><br />As their staff and board rallied friends to get out the vote, SCO was able to leverage what makes it unique in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a0bqvmsGRs"" target=""_blank"">the stories it shared</a>. On the flip side, when someone mentioned the idea of buying a print ad, we agreed that this decision would run counter to the organization’s personality and its commitment to efficiency.<br /><br />SCO ultimately won the contest with 40% of the one million votes cast, and they took home the big $500,000 prize.<br /><br />How can personality guide the way you build relationships with your supporters? Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an organization wants to be a vocal thought leader on a particular issue, it might create a YouTube channel that presents videos of experts on topics related to its mission.</li>
<li>If an organization is nurturing and inspiring, their blog might feature stories of people being helped or helping others.</li>
<li>If an organization is assertive and bold, it may use its Facebook page to ask provocative questions and encourage spirited conversations among its fans.</li>

You’ve tackled your new web design with the best of intentions. You’ve got a smart strategy. An amazing design. Navigation so user-friendly even your grandmother gets it. And then, uh oh, you remember that last pesky detail—who’s going to write the content that will populate your beautiful new site?</p>","<p>It’s an all-too-common omission. You’ve tackled your new web design with the best of intentions. You’ve got a smart strategy. An amazing design. Navigation so user-friendly even your grandmother gets it. And then, uh oh, you remember that last pesky detail—who’s going to write the content that will populate your beautiful new site?</p>
<p>The process of re-writing or re-evaluating web copy is often hurriedly tacked on to the end of the web development process. But, as usability expert Jakob Nielsen recently found, the lack of clear and compelling web content is&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/nonprofit-donations.html"" target=""_blank"">the number one complaint that potential donors cited about nonprofit websites</a>.</p>
<p>As Big Duck tackled our own site redesign—which you’ll see in just a few weeks (woot!)—here’s what we found most helpful in the process of writing, updating, and editing content from the old site to the new:</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Assign one content director, but share the load among several writers.</h3>
<p>Website users will jump from page to page on your site, so all of those pages should work together as a unified whole. For this reason, we started our web content process with one person. Our content director—using the site redesign strategy outlined in our project brief as a guide—was tasked to write the direction for all pages, make sure content followed the logic of our navigation, and assign a writer, an editor and a proofer for each page.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Take the time to give detailed instructions. It’s worth it.</h3>
<p>So what kind of direction did the content director end up giving our writers? Very detailed. We circulated a content spreadsheet with specific writing directions for each page, including exactly what needed to be communicated, any calls to action, links to include, reference material that could be used to write the copy, and word count. Each page also had a designated writer, reviewer, and proofer.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Urge writers, editors, and proofers to block off time early.</h3>
<p>To make sure that writers blocked off enough time to actually use our content spreadsheet, we then sent this heads up to writers, editors, and proofers:</p>
<p>You, lucky Duck, have been chosen as one of the writers of web copy for the new Big Duck website. Aren’t you excited? You are assigned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write six pages between 10/19 and 11/9</li>
<li>Edit nine pages between 11/10 and 11/16</li>
<li>Incorporate edits to the pages you wrote between 11/16 and 11/23</li>
<li>Proof six pages between 11/24 and 12/3</li>
</ul>
<p>Give your team a clear strategic background.</p>
<p>Our instructions didn’t end at scheduling. We wanted writers to know the strategy guiding the content direction, so we included a brief overview of the goals of the redesign. We also attached Big Duck’s brandraising guide (i.e. our style guide) as a reference for recommended tone and style, and sent comps of the new site design for visual context.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Provide clear instructions and structure.</h3>
<p>The intrepid Jenna Silverman was managing the content development process, and we tried to minimize the amount of work she had to do to keep everything in a standard format. For this reason we gave all writers, editors, and proofers standard naming convention for drafts (Ex: BigDuck_PAGETITLE_v1). Then we set up folders on our server, named according to the site map (Ex: COPY &gt; About Big Duck &gt; v1 &gt; BigDuck_OurTeam_v1.doc) so writers could simply save their drafts there instead of overwhelming Jenna’s inbox with attachments.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Once the content is incorporated, have one reader review the site in context.</h3>
<p>Our detailed instructions aside, we knew that some aspects of the copy would inevitably read differently once in context. So after the copy was loaded into our new design, we had one staff member block off time to do a final review of the site copy before launch. Just in case!</p>
<p>Have you come up some other good ways to manage the copywriting process for your website?</p>
<p>Please share it in the comments section!</p>

It’s simple, really—let your brand lead the way.</p>","<h2 class=""alt"">Six tips to get your campaign rolling</h2>
<p>There's no time like an August heat wave to start up your year-end campaign planning.<br /><br />No, we're not just being overachievers. When we do year-end campaigns for our clients, the many pieces we're weaving together—overarching concept, direct mail, email series or messages, splash page, donation landing page, and more—require that we begin now. Or at least now-ish.<br /><br />The summer months tend to be the ideal time to do some exploration and prime your year-end campaign pump, so that when the time comes to get a move on, you’re ready. You’ll also thank yourself come the colder months when things get really hectic. Here are six tips for getting the ball rolling.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look at your website through a donor’s eye.</strong>&nbsp;If all goes well with your year-end appeal, scores of supporters will flock to your website. Will they like what they see? We’re not talking about getting into a full-scale redesign, but take this opportunity to swap out those two-year-old photos on the homepage and update the copy inviting visitors to last year’s gala.</li>
<li><strong>Make a test donation.</strong>&nbsp;Navigate to your website, and make a $10 donation to your own organization. Is the donate button clear and easy to find? Is the form usable, and not too long? Have you customized the thank-you page and automated email messages?</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate your donor relationships through social media.</strong>&nbsp;Now is a great time to build and reinforce connections with your community through regular Facebook posts and tweets. Make sure you don’t just promote yourselves, though—ask interesting questions, share relevant updates, and show your appreciation. When your appeal lands in their inboxes and mailboxes four months from now, your supporters will be up to speed and ready to listen to your case for support.</li>
<li><strong>Start brainstorming</strong>.&nbsp;A strong year-end appeal grows out of a powerful concept and reinforces that concept at each touch point—on your website, in your emails, in your direct mail cards and letters, on your Facebook Page, and over the phone. What story will you tell with your year-end appeal? For guidance,&nbsp;<a href=""http://cts.vresp.com/c/?BigDuck/7626881a6f/TEST/613ba9a8d3"" target=""_blank"">check out these suggestions for a productive brainstorm</a>&nbsp;that we shared last summer.</li>
<li><strong>Get your cameras out.</strong>&nbsp;Nothing tells a story like a great photo, and you don’t want to be left scrambling when you need the perfect picture to accompany your tug-at-the-heartstrings email appeal. Rebecca recently wrote up some&nbsp;<a href=""http://cts.vresp.com/c/?BigDuck/7626881a6f/TEST/3e284b9ed2"" target=""_blank"">great tips for taking strong photos on a tight budget</a>over on the&nbsp;Duck Call.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade your toolset.</strong>&nbsp;If you’re thinking of weaving texting into your year-end campaign, or exploring a new program to let you send blast emails to your supporters, or changing up any of your tools and systems, now’s the time to research solutions and set up your accounts, so that you’re fluent and all the bumps are ironed out when the curtain goes up.</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot goes into a year-end appeal, especially when you make it multichannel. So here are a few past Duck Ponds and posts from the&nbsp;Duck Call&nbsp;you might find useful, if you’re ready to dig deeper:</p>

You’ve made a choice to dedicate your lives towards a goal that you’re passionate about. Some of the issues are pretty weighty. How can you even laugh when there are such critical issues facing the world?<br /><br />Well, sometimes the answer is, ""How can you not?"" Humor is a terrific coping mechanism. It's a great way to relieve stress and break down social barriers. But besides amusement, it can also be used to great effect to further your cause and spread your message. How many viral videos are forwarded just because they're funny?<br /><br />The Ducks, too, are pretty serious-minded. We love diving into the issues of the day, our work motivates us, and we love making a difference on behalf of our clients. But we also really enjoy each other. When you poll our staff, one of the reasons we like working here is that we get some pretty good laughs in during the typical day. Perhaps you’ve noticed that&nbsp;<a href=""/about/values"" target=""_blank"">""good fun"" is one of our values</a>. We mean it.<br /><br />So how can you best harness the power of humor?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make time for it.</strong>&nbsp;If you’re having a creative brainstorm for any reason, build in a bit more time than you think is necessary. A little up-front silly time will help the creative juices flow throughout the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Be open.</strong>&nbsp;We deal with lots of ""sad truths"" in the nonprofit world. Sometimes the obstacles are upsetting. But ask any professional comedian: there’s terrific humor to be mined from the places that make us angry. Humor can be your coping mechanism. Be open to it.</li>
<li><strong>Pay it off.</strong>&nbsp;Humor can grab attention. If you’ve found the comedic hook to your campaign, for example, don’t forget to bring it back to the action you want the audience to take. Funny is good. Funny that leads to action is great.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a big topic. And our very own&nbsp;Design Director Sonny Mui&nbsp;gets into a bit more detail, including a few examples of good humor used well, in his&nbsp;<a href=""/blog/good_humor"" target=""_blank"">blog post on the subject</a>.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1,1408%2","","","","","Duck-Pond humor personality","DuckPond","<p><span>Photo by artclassy.com</span></p>",

Try rolling out a new identity!</p>","<p>Last month we discussed some of the&nbsp;content challenges of relaunching your website. But what’s even more thrilling-slash-terrifying than rolling out a new site? Try rolling out a new identity!</p>
<p>A successful new identity—logo, colors, messages, etc.—is grounded in your nonprofit’s vision, mission, values, positioning, and personality, so even if you’re making big changes to the way you look and talk, it should still feel familiar and right.&nbsp;But it’s still important to present your new identity to supporters in a way that makes them feel connected and involved. At its best, rolling out a new brand can be an invigorating moment, inspiring your community to forge onward and upward. At its worst, misunderstandings and lack of buy-in can hamper the effectiveness of the new brand for months, if not years.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Here are a few tips to consider when and if you roll out a new brand…</h3>
<p><strong>1. Start with a solid strategy.</strong><br />We know new brands are exciting. But don’t start sharing anything about your new identity without a rollout strategy.&nbsp;Consider the three types of rollouts—<a href=""/three_ways_to_roll_out_your_new_brand"">the flipped switch, the phased launch, and the rolling launch</a>.&nbsp;To determine the best rollout for you, start by considering how big of a change you are making and how your community might react. Ask yourself: How much loyalty does our community have to our old identity? How much time and resources do our staff members have to dedicate to a rebrand? Is there an event or moment in the coming year that would make sense to roll out the new brand to our community?</p>
<p><strong>2. Train your staff and board on the new brand…before you launch it to the world.</strong><br />After all, they are your brand’s ambassadors, and they need to feel just as excited as the senior leadership. Consider role-playing and cheat sheets on how to use new language. And if you’ve put all the dos and don’ts about the new identity into a style guide (we hope you have!), it is a great idea to review it together during a special meeting.</p>
<p><strong>3. Engage your community.</strong><br />The keys to a successful rollout are a well-developed new brand and a community that embraces it. Here are two ways we recommend you prepare your community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you roll out, preview the new brand with key stakeholders (""super fans"") to build buy-in and excitement early.</li>
<li>Share the inside story with your community. Whether at a major event or as part of gradual shift, let them know the strategic reasons behind the work and what you’re hoping to achieve moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Have a communications plan for life beyond rollout.</strong><br />Once you’ve rolled out your new identity, it’s important to have an idea of how you’ll be communicating in the next twelve to eighteen months. We recommend drafting a plan that includes links to resources like the style guide, a calendar of upcoming messages and communications, and a schedule for any additional elements that still need to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don’t forget the small stuff.</strong><br />Posting the new logo on your website (or redoing it) is important, but be sure to reflect the new identity across all channels, including online, in print, in person, on air, and through mobile. From old names still recorded on voicemail, to old logos lingering on your YouTube page—even the smallest details can undermine your brand’s effectiveness and confuse your community.</p>

So we’re devoting this month’s Duck Pond to three basic, low-tech tools that will help you communicate better than any fancy apps you’ve got on your mobile device.<br /><br /><strong>1. The auto-responder.</strong><br />Going on vacation? Offline while traveling, or in meetings? Don’t forget to set up an auto-responder that lets people know that you’re out, when you’ll be back, and whom to contact in your absence. Too often this simple step gets overlooked, but it’s a powerful way to help your donors, colleagues, partners, and the media feel they’re getting what they need from you. Don’t be afraid to use your auto-responder for everyday work-related absences or events, not just vacation. Letting people know that your gala is next week so you’re responding slowly to email this week or offline entirely can be extremely helpful, for instance. Setting them up is easy. If you don’t know how, ask the person who helps with your IT.<br /><br />Here’s a draft we encourage you to take and make your own:</p>
<blockquote><i>Subject: Auto-responder/I’m out<br /><br />Hello! I’m offline until (date) working/vacationing/watching reality television shows. During that time, I’ll be checking email less frequently than usual. Please contact XX at (phone/email) if you need something immediately. Otherwise, I’ll be back and likely to respond to your email the week of XX.<br /><br />(your email signature)</i></blockquote>
<p>Injecting a little humor in your auto-responder often gets people to pay closer attention, too. Give it a try!</p>
<p><strong>2. The email signature.</strong><br />At its simplest, a good email signature helps ensure that folks you want to reach have your correct name, title, organization, and contact information and saves them time tracking down your phone number.</p>
<p>But an email signature can also be a great way to promote your organization’s online presence. Here’s an example of what we Ducks use:<br /><br /><span><span>........................................................................................</span><br />Sarah Durham | Principal<br /><br />Big Duck | Smart Communications for Nonprofits<br />t 718 237 9551 ext 12 m 718 344 6027<br /><a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.bigducknyc.com</a><br /><br /><span>........................................................................................</span><br />Join me:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog"" target=""_blank"">Blog</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=""http://twitter.com/bigducksarah"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bigducksarah"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;| AIM: bigducksarah<br /><span>........................................................................................</span><br /></span></p>
<p>We prefer a mix of links to help you stay in touch with us individually (LinkedIn, AIM) and to connect people with Big Duck (blog, website). Be sure to stay professional: don’t link to your personal Facebook profile unless you really want all of your work contacts to friend you.</p>
<p>Try using a standard typeface common on most computers (Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman, for instance) at a specific size and perhaps a color that relates well to your organization’s visual identity. Better yet, ask the person in charge of your organization’s brand to set up a standard email signature everyone can use so it feels consistent. Avoid using your logo or other elements as attached JPEG files—they often get filtered out on the recipient’s end and can create other problems.</p>
<p>Setting up email signatures is simple in most email programs—look through your “Preferences” menu, or ask your IT person to teach you to set one up.</p>
<p><strong>3. Your voice</strong><br />Email rocks, but there are times when the phone or face-to-face is simply the smarter way to communicate. Here are two key situations when you should really pick up the phone or get together instead of hitting ”reply”:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When the message involves bad news or negative information.</em><br />Bad news is best expressed and delivered in a more personal way, so that you can help the recipient understand and process it. Don’t email your program person that the funding for their favorite program just got cut—pick up the phone and call them, or better yet, walk down the hall and meet with them about it face-to-face.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>When the implications are complex or very subtle.</em><br />Irony and complicated ideas are often missed in email. If what you’re communicating really needs to be understood thoroughly, talk about it first. Then use email as a written reminder of what you’ve discussed.</li>

Two Tips.","","1001","Big Duck","<p>It’s fun to geek out on the relative merits of, say,&nbsp;<a href=""http://hootsuite.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hootsuite</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a>.&nbsp; But ultimately, communicating clearly and effectively only has so much to do with the technology you use. So we’re devoting this month’s Duck Pond to three basic, low-tech tools that will help you communicate better than any fancy apps you’ve got on your mobile device.</p>","<p>People’s reading habits have changed. Attention spans are shorter. We’re all just too busy. So if you want to reach your audiences, you must know how to write less. Easier said than done, of course.</p>
<p>Here’s one of our favorite quotations, usually credited to the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century French philosopher Blaise Pascal (and often mistakenly credited to Mark Twain): “I have made this letter longer than usual, only because I have not had the time to make it shorter.”</p>
<p>Anyone who writes a lot can confirm the truth in this statement. But how do you write less and still say all you need to say?</p>
<p>There are lots of things you can do, but in the spirit of brevity, we’ll start with just two tips. They’re not always simple, but they’ll help you reach the people you need to reach with fewer words and more confidence.</p>
<p><strong>1. “Be” not.</strong></p>
<p>Use action verbs instead of being verbs. When you finish your first draft, change all or most of your being verbs (i.e.,&nbsp;be,&nbsp;is, etc.) into action verbs. Your prose immediately becomes more concise and direct. An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being verb: Our programs are helping young people discover new opportunities.<br />Action verb: Our programs propel young people into new opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Obviously, the appropriateness of the action verb itself depends on your organization and the context, but you get the point, right?)</p>
<p><strong>2. Passive voice should be avoided.</strong></p>
<p>Better yet, avoid passive voice. If you find lots of being verbs in your writing, it probably indicates a fondness for passive voice. Note the&nbsp;be&nbsp;in the heading above.</p>
<p>The biggest reason that you, as a nonprofit communicator, should use active voice is that it helps you assert success, whereas passive voice defers responsibility. The classic example of passive voice that we hear, especially from politicians, is, “Mistakes were made.” Well, who the heck made them? A more positive example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive voice: Clients are referred to stellar educational services.<br />Active voice: We refer clients to stellar educational services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s only a tiny bit shorter, but it expresses your role in the work. Own your good work, nonprofiteers!</p>
<p>We can write about the subject of writing less for days, ironically enough (especially if we’re trying to be brief). But the tips above will help you avoid a couple of common pitfalls we often see in the nonprofit world. And by writing less, people will read you more.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in more on this subject, we have a third tip that’s a bit more complicated—and probably even more valuable—than the first two.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/avoid_the_daunting_blank_page"">You’ll find it on the Duck Call blog</a>.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","0","1067%1,1416%2","","","","","Duck-Pond copywriting","DuckPond","",

Making changes to your organization’s communications is difficult, too.</p>
<p>Even seemingly small changes (like creating a new brochure) and positive changes (like developing a new brand that will help your nonprofit raise money and visibility more effectively) can be tricky and frustrating.</p>
<p>Just when you’re putting the finishing touches to that brochure, a chorus of voices asks whether it’s actually necessary. You roll out your new brand but people keep producing materials using the old one.</p>
<p>So what can you do to avoid those situations and make your efforts as high-impact as possible?</p>
<p>The following strategies work no matter what kind of change you’re involved in—whether it’s a shift in your communications culture, a relocation, or something even bigger, like a change in your nonprofit’s mission.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be clear about what it is you’re really trying to change.</strong><br />Before you start to make changes, think carefully about what you’re hoping to achieve and whether the change you’re about to make really is the right way to get there.<br /><br />For example, if you’re struggling to explain your organization clearly to your audiences, it’s tempting to create new materials that explain things better. But if you’re having a hard time explaining yourself, chances are you need to change your messaging, not just your materials.<br /><br />Focus on why you need to change things before thinking about what you need to change. Start by writing a project brief that identifies your goals, the audiences you’re trying to reach, and the measurable results you want to achieve. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to start thinking about what you need to change to get there.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</strong><br />Don’t change things just for the sake of change. Before you embark on any project to change your communications, big or small, make sure you have solid strategic reasons for doing so. Take a step back and ask yourself whether the change you’re proposing will really help you achieve your communication goals.<br /><br />Conduct some informal research—like an online survey, interviews, or informal focus groups with your supporters—to find out whether your communications are doing what they need to. If the answer’s no, it’s probably time for a change. But if the answer’s yes, you might be better off directing your time, energy, and budget elsewhere.</li>

The hustle and bustle of year-end fundraising is over, and there are ten glorious months separating you and the next December rush… It’s time to put your feet up for a well-earned rest, right?<br /><br />Sadly, no. Your 2011 year-end donors are excited about your mission now. And if they don’t see anything except your monthly e-newsletter and occasional Facebook updates until next December, even the sexiest 2012 year-end campaign won’t make up for your lost momentum.<br /><br />So what should you send your supporters now to keep them engaged and excited?&nbsp;<strong>Since recent studies state that&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.blackbaud.com/bb/advocacy/Advocates-Donors.aspx"" target=""_blank"">nonprofit advocates are seven times more likely to give than non-advocates</a>, you might want to consider adding several non-fundraising actions to this year’s online communications calendar.</strong><br /><br />Your donors are happy to give you financial support, but many of them want to do more to advance your mission. Whether you launch a comprehensive advocacy campaign or the simplest online quiz, online actions can engage your supporters in several crucial ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Periodic actions keep your organization “top of mind,” in a good way.</strong>&nbsp;Sure, you’d get some attention if you started sending nothing but appeals every month. But a quick rise in your “unsubscribe” rates is not the kind of attention you’re looking for. By giving your supporters an action to take beyond donating—you gently remind them about your organization’s ongoing work and value. Even if they don’t take the action every time, just seeing your name in their inbox makes your organization easier to remember when year-end season rolls around again.</li>
<li><strong>Actions make donors feel like they’re part of the story, not an ATM.</strong>&nbsp;Beyond making your organization more visible, online actions also help donors feel like they’re active partners in your work, not just someone you come to when you need funds. Over time, this will build trust and investment in a deeper way than donations alone could achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Actions “show, don’t tell” why your work matters.</strong>&nbsp;Your high school English teacher was right—you’ll make your case more effectively if you demonstrate it through actions, not description. Whether your supporter takes a quiz and shares a surprising answer with a friend, retweets your latest petition, or writes their Congressperson and then sees new legislation passed, online actions help supporters understand the importance of your work in a way that even the most eloquent appeal cannot.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the best part? You don’t need a fancy advocacy program or even a legislative agenda to energize your supporters. With a little creativity, any nonprofit can start engaging its supporters with action as well as donations.<br /><br /><em>Not sure where to start? Want some ideas for how to make it happen?

<p>My desk at Big Duck features a lovely view of <a href=""http://www.watchtower.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Watchtower</a> in Brooklyn. If you don't know The Watchtower, it's home to the Jehovah's Witnesses. More specifically, it is the national headquarters for their magazine publication. The property is a sprawling compound (called Bethel by the insiders), several buildings and blocks large, and the J-Dubs cover a good chunk of Dumbo, living amongst the nouveau riche that otherwise populate the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Opinions about the Jehovah's Witnesses range from ""they are the one true faith,"" to ""I haven't given them much thought,"" and all the way to the other side of ""they're a cult."" I won't take a stand on that one today.</p>
<p>What I will say is that The Watchtower has a good tagline: Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9a6e2c36ccb4d44a5fb5addd4d885e86/files/dumbowatchtower1_300x225.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""225"" width=""300"" /></p>
<p>Taglines always appear with names. The Watchtower, as a name on its own, doesn't say what it is. Unless we were insiders (i.e. J-Dubs), we wouldn't know that The Watchtower is the official publication of the Jehovah's Witnesses. ""Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom"" helps clarify what it is.</p>
<p>When we work on taglines here at Big Duck, we try to keep to a general rule of eight words or less. This can be a real challenge, especially if a client needs us to somehow explain what it is that they do with the tagline. For example, if a nonprofit working in arts and education needs ""arts and education"" in the tagline, that's three of the eight words eaten up already, adding to the challenge.</p>
<p>The Watchtower nailed their tagline in a total of three words. The publication, The Watchtower, announces Jehovah's Kingdom. So simple. So concise.</p>
<p>Technically, I suppose, The Watchtower is a sub-brand of the overall Jehovah's Witness brand. I don't know what their overall tagline is, or if they even have one. I don't have a view of it.</p>
<p>As it is, that concise tagline stares me down every day, and especially during the past few weeks, when we're working on several brand identities (logos and taglines) simultaneously, The Watchtower's tagline taunts me, throwing down a gauntlet, ringing my metaphorical doorbell every single day, challenging me to rise to their level of tagline excellence.</p>
<p>Now if I really wanted to delve more deeply into this conversation, I suppose I'd have to talk about the Jehovah's Witnesses' approach to ""experiential marketing."" They have a very strong word-of-mouth campaign going, it seems.</p>
<p>But that will have to be a subject for another day.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1,1409%2","","","","tagline-goes-door-door","","","",

<li><strong>If the British monarchy can open up and use social media, there's no excuse for your organization not to.</strong><br /> Apparently, the British monarchy has been on social media for a while, and it's using its <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/home.php#%21/TheBritishMonarchy"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/theroyalchannel"" target=""_blank"">YouTube channel</a>; <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/clarencehouse"" target=""_blank"">Prince Charles's Twitter account</a>; and a dedicated <a href=""http://www.officialroyalwedding2011.org"" target=""_blank"">royal wedding website and live blog</a> to keep people involved in the wedding. If an institution as big, old, and conservative as the British royal family is happy to open up, share, and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/facebook/posts/163209313738381"" target=""_blank"">ask open questions and hear negative responses in public</a>, maybe it's time your organization started doing that too?<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social media can help make your big events more inclusive.</strong><br /> Even though the guest list is no doubt huge, not everyone in the UK can attend the big event itself. But the royal household seems to be doing a pretty good job of helping people who want to feel part of it get involved in other ways. On YouTube, they've released <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovFwNZHclMk"" target=""_blank"">an invitation to the live-stream of the wedding</a> and started <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8O44RQ_aWw&amp;feature=channel_video_title"" target=""_blank"">a video guest book of user-generated messages to the couple</a>. There's also a <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheBritishMonarchy?sk=app_176520635729525"" target=""_blank"">dedicated Facebook page where people can share stories</a> about how they're celebrating, and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=101946883225381"" target=""_blank"">a Facebook event so people can show they're ""attending"" and get updates about the day</a>. Oh, and the royals are giving everyone in the UK the day off work, too, which helps.<br /><br />Your annual gala and other big events probably aren't <em>quite</em> as big as the royal wedding (and you can't give people the day off to attend), but you can still use social media to help individual donors who can't attend feel engaged and involved in them. You might share ""exclusives"" about high-profile attendees with your social media supporters in the run up to the event. On the day, you could live-stream speeches or entertainment, or share live updates from your Chief Executive or high-profile supporters on Twitter (hat tip to Daniel Buckey from <a href=""http://www.foodbanknyc.org/"" target=""_blank"">Food Bank for New York City</a> for that suggestion).</li>

<li value=""3""><strong>Is your donation page wedding gift friendly?</strong><br />To avoid getting ten thousand identical toasters from their adoring public, Will and Kate have set up <a href=""http://www.royalweddingcharityfund.org/"" target=""_blank"">a charitable gift fund</a> to which they've asked people to donate to support the couple's selected charities. The <a href=""http://www.royalweddingcharityfund.org/"" target=""_blank"">nice looking website</a> makes donating and choosing where your donation goes as easy as possible.<br /><br /> How does your donation page measure up? Is it easy for people to navigate and to understand how to make a gift in someone else's honor?

<li>Remember <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/power-pages-weekly-roundup"" target=""_blank"">the Facebook Pages upgrade we talked about in the roundup a month ago</a> (how could you forget?)? This week, <a href=""http://www.allfacebook.com/new-facebook-pages-layout-becomes-mandatory-2011-03"" target=""_blank"">Facebook made the new Page layout mandatory</a>. If you don't check your nonprofit's Facebook page all that regularly (don't worry, I won't tell anyone), now might be a good time to go and do that, to make sure everything's still looking lovely.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Whether your organization has the new Facebook Page layout or no Facebook Page at all, you should still have a clear and well-thought-out social media policy in place. Stephanie Schwab's post on Social Media Explorer this week lays out <a href=""http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/the-anatomy-of-a-social-media-policy/"" target=""_blank"">the essentials for crafting a comprehensive but fair social media policy</a>. How does your organization's policy measure up?</li>

What's the difference between a group and a page? What do you mean I need to claim a vanity URL? Can I just have a cause? I think someone just threw a sheep at me...Facebook for organizations is confusing, and that's kind of the point. Facebook hangs its hat on privacy (communities of people you know, like your campus or your city or your workplace) and user control (deep privacy settings that let you say who sees your content and, to a certain extent, whose content you see). The appeal of privacy and control is part of what makes Facebook different from others in the social networking space. It's part of why Facebook has grown XX% in the past quarter, while MySpace has continued a steady downward trend.100 million people joined Facebook in the past three months, and it probably wasn't because they're thirsty for your nonprofit's status updates. Facebook knows its audience: the individual user.So is it impossible for organizations to maintain a valuable presence on Facebook? Of course not. Some companies are doing a stellar job--and many nonprofits are finding innovative ways to raise money from their networks on Facebook. But don't expect it to be easy. Because your organization is not the target audience.As one of the lucky (?) ones who's been on Facebook from the very beginning, I've seen the growth--gradual and then rapid--of the Facebook community, and the services it offers.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","blog/draft-facebook-you-not-your-organization","","","",

(You can follow us there now.)We ended up in a similar situation with our Facebook page. As a business, we couldn't claim a vanity URL until the hordes of Facebook users had already had three weeks to snag one for themselves. By the time it was our turn, the username ""BigDuck"" was long gone.When Facebook instituted a policy allowing every Facebook user to change their username once, and only once, our connector Farra sprung into action. She friended the gentleman who'd claimed our preferred username, built up a friendly rapport, and convinced him to set the name free for us to claim. Fans can now find us at www.facebook.com/bigduck.It's a generous world, this world of social media. We're grateful to the kind people who shared so cheerfully, and hope for opportunities to pass the good karma along. It gives us renewed hope in our efforts to prise ""www.bigduck.com"" away from Big Duck's Harpsichord Miscellany.I read an article recently likening social media to a cocktail party--if you only talk about yourself, you'll prove an unpopular conversation companion. I like that metaphor, but I also like to think of social media as neighborhoods. Your neighbors could be anyone--peers, competitors, volunteers, distant fans, or even random individuals who just happen to share your name. People form alliances, make friends, stop to chat, and sometimes, they're just plain neighborly.How can you be neighborly in social media?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","blog/draft-so-thats-why-they-call-it-social","","","",

It keeps you honest--no more jargon!--and pushes you toward making decisions based on what the user is looking for, not what you ""like"".I had an opportunity to participate in user testing for two different organizations recently--they both took very different approaches with different goals in mind, and it might be interesting to consider if either would be relevant for your site.<strong>Donors Choose</strong>DonorsChoose is an online nonprofit that allows visitors to make a donation to a project of their choice, submitted by teachers in classrooms around the country. As their website is their center of operations, it's a truly critical tool in support of their mission, so it makes sense that user testing in their case would be a regular and ongoing investment.PROCESS<ul>	<li>Recruit online for volunteers, through listservs and emails</li>	<li>Sign volunteers up for 45 minute sessions, on weekday evenings after work, at the DonorsChoose offices</li>	<li>The volunteer sits in a separate room, on a computer that's running the site locally (i.e. not the version live online). A webcam and screencast recording program chronicle the user's comments and clickpaths as she navigates through the site.</li>	<li>A DonorsChoose employee asks the user to complete a few different tasks--such as making a ""donation"" to a project, or setting up a personal fundraising page. The prompter asks questions, but can't answer any that the user may ask.</li>	<li>As the user navigates the site, she offers a running commentary on the actions she's taking, what she's looking for, and why.</li></ul>This is a low-cost, easy-to-implement solution that gives them a steady stream of feedback for making updates to the site. The overhead costs are basically an old laptop, the software that records the test, and your staff person's time. Of course, none of that is valuable without the resources to DO something with your findings, so if you don't have in-house coders or web strategists, this probably isn't worth doing unless you have funds available to make some changes.<strong>TechSoup</strong>Tech Soup provides technology resources to nonprofits of all shapes and sizes. They're in the process of redeveloping their website--it already has a snazzy new homepage--and are soliciting user feedback to their designs.PROCESS<ul>	<li>Recruit participants on listservs</li>	<li>Schedule an hour for volunteers to participate either remotely (via webinar) or in-person (if possible)</li>	<li>Set up a webinar connection via ReadyTalk</li>	<li>Ask the user for feedback and opinions to alternate versions of a site map (e.g. which title of the section do you prefer?)</li></ul>It's not the live site, but it's a great way to get some feedback as you're going through the process. And no better way to make sure you keep your audiences in mind.http://www.slideshare.net/ext337/techsoup-global-soup-overviewFor many nonprofits, this is the context in which you're likeliest to user test: in the context of website redevelopment. If you're thinking of creating a new website, ask the companies you're working with how they'd suggest incorporating user feedback, and whether they can work it into the process.Takeaways:<ul>	<li>Wow, is outside perspective important! What makes sense to your organization doesn't necessarily make sense to the visitor.</li>	<li>You may be trying to think objectively--what does my audience need or like?--but your audiences aren't. They're thinking: ""What do I need or like?""</li>	<li>Don't distract your visitors. My eye kept catching on little changes I wasn't expecting--it's jarring to a site visitor.</li>	<li>Say thanks! DonorsChoose gave me a couple of $25 gift cards to support a project on their website, and I was so delighted! What a lovely gesture. Obviously I'm already interested in the work that they do, since I'm volunteering, so it's an acknowledgement that I appreciate. My only suggestion: give me one of those cards at the beginning of the testing session, and have me use it to make a donation! They they'd really have seen my thinking at work, as I took pains to make sure I was putting the donated dollars toward what's most interesting to me.</li></ul>A few simple, low-cost solutions for getting user feedback:<ul>	<li>A poll on your website soliciting feedback from site visitors to a specific question or two</li>	<li>A survey to your email list (this could go out before site design, to get their suggestions and explore their needs, or after, to solicit feedback to chosen designs)</li>	<li><a href=""http://fivesecondtest.com/"">http://fivesecondtest.com/</a>--allows      you to solicit simple, instantaneous feedback to website designs</li>	<li><a href=""http://www.usertesting.com/"">http://www.UserTesting.com</a>--this service and others like it offer videos of average web users interacting with your page and providing their opinions</li></ul>It's definitely an eye-opener to be on the user end of things--I recommend it.

<p>With so much important work left to do, many organizations don't stop to celebrate the good work they've done. That is, until their anniversary. If I had a nickel for every time a nonprofit has told me their doing something special for their 15th anniversary (or so), I could fund your endowment.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>And that's the problem.</p>
<p>Most organizations worth their salt will be around for many years, which means that your nonprofit's anniversary, much like your own birthday, isn't that significant for people who aren't very close to you.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't celebrate your anniversary. What I'm saying is, use it as an excuse to do something else, since most folks won't be likely to throw confetti or write a check because it's your anniversary alone. Launch a new program, unveil your new branding, or throw a party for your loyal supporters (volunteers, for instance, or donors) for instance.</p>
<p>On a related note, Big Duck is launching our new blog, the Duck Call, to celebrate our own milestone: 15 years helping nonprofits communicate. We'll use it as a platform to celebrate smart nonprofit communications, explore relevant issues, and just plain have fun. There are many excellent nonprofit communications blogs and Twitter streams out there already. Ours will aim to add a different perspective- one that integrates strategy with creative- adding perhaps a more design-focused point of view. All members of the <a href=""/about/team/"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck team</a> will be contributing. We hope you'll find it a useful resource and tell us what you think along the way.</p>
<p>And if you're still thinking about your organization's anniversary, check out this article (from January 2006) in the <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/premium/articles/v18/i06/06002901.htm"" target=""_blank"">Chronicle of Philanthropy</a> for the (perhaps less skeptical) opinions of others on this topic.

We grabbed our seats, got some food, and cheered on.&nbsp; Despite my Mets affiliation, I was happy to root for the Staten Island Yankees (who won it 5-2).&nbsp; Beyond the <a href=""http://www.dippindots.com/"" target=""_blank"">Dippin' Dots</a>, I think the highlight of the game was seeing our name on the big marquis.&nbsp; We were definitely the proudest group there.</p>

You're probably wearing a t-shirt right now with a phrase like that on it, I'll wager. If we're going to do great work, it might stand to reason that we should love coming to work. If we're going to be effective communicators with external audiences, we should really communicate well internally first, right? But how many people do you know who really focus on office communications and quality of life? So a few years ago, we Ducks began implementing a few things internally that help us remember to take care of ourselves so we are in a strong position to do better work. Here are a few ideas we've implemented here we hope you'll steal and use in your office. <!--break--></p>
<p><strong>Duck of the week:</strong> Every week, a Duck of the Week is selected by the previous week's Duck of the Week during staff meeting. This is a great chance to celebrate hard work, or even a co-worker's birthday, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Green team:</strong> A small task force of people meets periodically to help make the office more environmentally friendly. Our green team has helped dramatically reduce Big Duck's electricity bills, changed our personal habits, promoted more effective recycling, and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>(Free) intranet where you can share cool stuff:</strong> we built our own private intranet using the <a href=""http://www.ning.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ning</a> platform, which is free. We post work-related stuff but also fun stuff too- like pictures we take at staff events, or other things that remind us that we like each other.</p>
<p><strong>Wellness activities:</strong> We've been working together to try and improve our collective health and balance for several years. Wellness activities have included having health counselors come in and give us tips, <a href=""http://hundredpushups.com/"" target=""_blank"">an office contest to do 100 push ups</a>, a wellness month with prizes, and more.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/f4acaf3c9d39cb53d3fd4c5388f75ead/files/bikes"" border=""0"" /><br /><br />Bike riding to work is encouraged. Why not get your heart racing before work, rather than while you're there?</p>
<p><strong>Treating each other:</strong> Every Friday, someone on our staff brings in snacks for the rest of the crew. Often it's bagels, or maybe fruit- but occasionally people get really creative- waffle-making or homemade guacamole on Cinco de Mayo, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""mceTemp mceIEcenter""><dl class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 310px;""><dt><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/f4acaf3c9d39cb53d3fd4c5388f75ead/files/waffle"" border=""0"" /></dt><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""><br />Waffles make Kristin smile.</dt><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt></dl>

<dl class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" id=""attachment_122"" style=""width: 310px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dt class=""wp-caption-dt"">Sonny playing with his food.</dt></dl></div>
<p>Not only do these activities give us a chance to have fun together, they make it easier, somehow, during crunch times to hunker down and get to work. If you work someplace that values team building, that's a good indicator that you've developed a culture that values individuals. This can only help your work, right? <a href=""http://ijs-online.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Institute for Jewish Spirituality</a>, for instance, has yoga breaks during staff meetings. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>Please leave a comment here and let us know what happens in your office that helps people to feel valued and engaged. We'll be sure to share some of the fun we have in future Duck Calls, so stay tuned.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1067%1,1408%2","","","","think-globally-act-your-office","","","",

Our answers of course range based on who we are talking to, but they always start with recommending a good strategy with tactics that connect back to an organization's mission, audiences, and resources. One of our favorite ideas to share is the use of a donor profile or testimonials. Showing who your donors are and why they support your organization, can not only serve to validate existing donors, but it can help attract new ones--who might see themselves in your profiled donors. And what's great about this idea is that any organization can start profiling donors immediately (assuming they have a newsletter, enewsletter, website or other channel to do so).</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />We've seen a great example of this idea in action in the regular <a href=""http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/IPonline/June2009.php"" target=""_blank"">""Why I Give: A Donor Profile"" in every issue of The Innocence Project's monthly enewsletter</a>. Every profile includes the donor's name, a picture, a description of how they personally relate to the organization's mission, reasons for supporting the organization, and then an ask -- with a link back to the organization's donation page.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/85a5f811412dba5518353e427dc80c2f/files/image1"" border=""0"" /><br />Part of ""Why I Give"" profile from Innocence Project's monthly enewsletter</p>
<p><br />I asked Matt Kelley, Online Communications Manager for the Innocence Project, about the thinking and impact behind this feature and he had some interesting things to say:<br /><br /><strong>Farra:</strong> When did you start including the ""Why I Give"" element in the enewsletter and why?<br /><strong>Matt:</strong> We started it with the launch of our email newsletter in February 2007, in an effort to convey the critical importance of individual donors from diverse backgrounds on our work and to emphasize the sense of community in our email newsletter.<br />Our donors come from all kinds of backgrounds and span the political and ideological spectrum. We wanted to demonstrate to subscribers that they are members of a community and that people just like them donate in varying amounts.<br /><strong>Farra: </strong>What kind of reaction have you received to those profiles? Do people click on the donation link below the story and/or have you noticed any impact on giving as a result?<br /><strong>Matt:</strong> Since they've always been in our e-newsletter, I can't separate out whether we raise more with ""Why I Give"" than we would without, but we do receive several donations each month from subscribers who click through the ""Why I Give"" profile.<br /><strong>Farra:</strong> How much time is involved in writing the profile, getting permission/photos, producing it, etc?<br /><strong>Matt:</strong> I spend about 2-3 hours each month to produce this profile for the enewsletter, collaborating with the featured donor. But every time I speak to a donor with a unique perspective on our work or hear an interesting story about one of our supporters, I invite that person to submit a ""Why I Give"" statement - so we usually have a few of these profiles ready to go.<br /><strong>Farra: </strong>How have people reacted to the profile? Have you received any feedback?<br /><strong>Matt:</strong> We've heard from dozens of subscribers who love it, they enjoy reading about others in this movement with them and I think it does build a sense of community and solidarity to see people like yourself supporting the work. In a focus group with 25 subscribers, we asked for open-ended reviews of the newsletter and the ""Why I Give"" section was barely mentioned. Then, when we asked them to rank sections in order of importance, ""Why I Give"" was near the bottom. I take this result to mean that it's subtle enough as to not distract from the core message of the work.<br />We recently received our first unsolicited ""Why I Give"" statement from a donor who reads the newsletter. We were so excited that he was inspired to write to us telling us why he became a supporter, and we hope to see more of that. He will be featured in August.</p>
<p><br />Does your organization profile donors in any way? What works? What doesn't? We'd love to hear your thoughts...</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1405%2,2059%3","","","","looking-simple-way-get-new-donors-show-them-who-supports-you","","","",

Instead of gently asking Americans to become video volunteers, for example, All for Good created the ""The World Sucks: Help it Suck Less"" video which pokes fun at nerdy, agoraphobic YouTube nerds in an effort to boost volunteerism.</p>

First, they both speak the language of their target audiences, not that the organizations behind them. They're casual, funny, and perhaps offensive, depending on your point of view. They're not afraid to push the envelope. They have relatively low production value. Instead, the energy behind these projects went into developing a great creative concept. Lastly, they don't try to appeal to everyone: they focus their efforts on a select group and work hard to get them to take action.<br /><br />Next time you're developing an outreach campaign, consider speaking to your target audience in their own language- even if it's more casual, caustic or silly than you're used to. Try it with a focused campaign and monitor the results.

Considering everything else there is to worry about these days, it seems like an easy idea to dismiss. After all, do we really need to spend tax dollars making sure things look nice?The short answer is, <em>Yes. Absolutely.</em></p>
<!--break-->
<p>As Arieff writes:""Design touches all sectors of our daily life, and increasing awareness of that reality can result in tremendous benefit for all. Is design about aesthetics? Of course it is, but that's just one of its many facets. Design can save time, money and one's sanity. It can simplify use, enhance enjoyment, and keep us safe and well.""</p>
<p>Too often, when people hear design they mistake it for decoration--embellishment or prettying-up that is essentially useless. But good design is more often the opposite, calling little or no attention to itself while making its underlying message clear and understandable. And clarity can make a huge difference when it comes to public policy. Developing effective government initiatives, Arieff points out, is ""not just about policy and economics but how well information is presented to the broader public.""</p>
<p>One prime example of this is the proposed <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24gibson.html"" target=""_blank"">Credit Card Facts disclosure sheet</a> below, which takes inspiration from the standard Nutrition Facts that appear on food labels. It's enough to make you wonder how many families' fiscal woes, the result of poorly-understood mortgage or loan agreements, could have been avoided if only the terms were set out this clearly.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/904e0cf1a0721942ca5086cac9094e4a/files/facts"" border=""0"" /></p>
<p>The apparent <a href=""http://www.good.is/post/scaring-america-with-badly-designed-health-care-infographics/"" target=""_blank"">disaster of a flow chart</a> below is another clever bit of design work. Circulated by the Republicans, this diagram of the Democratic health care plan is intentionally made to look clunky, convoluted, and just plain ugly. If it can scare off enough support for the plan, this could be a case of design directly influencing public policy.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/904e0cf1a0721942ca5086cac9094e4a/files/flowchart"" border=""0"" /></p>
<p>The fundamental argument for design in these and other examples is that <em>how you say something is just as important as what you say</em>. This reasoning is at the heart of the newly-formed US National Design Policy Initiative, which ""advocates for a governmental plan of action to support design in service of U.S. economic competitiveness and democratic governance."" It's a worthwhile and timely effort, and I only wish they'd listened to their own advice in developing <a href=""http://www.designpolicy.org/"" target=""_blank"">their website</a>. Good design can be useful, useable, and beautiful. This is certainly what they're saying...just not quite how they're saying it.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1415%1","","","","designing-way-better-public-policy","","","",

When I said that I was, he revealed that he was a reporter for The Brooklyn Paper and asked me what I thought of the new sign out front.<br /><br /></p>","<p>A few days ago, I wandered over to the Dumbo General Store for my afternoon coffee, and an outgoing fellow at the bar (yes, it’s also a bar and, even though I’m a writer, I drink coffee, not liquor) asked me if I was a regular. When I said that I was, he revealed that he was a reporter for The Brooklyn Paper and asked me what I thought of the new sign out front.</p>
<p>I had noticed the sign but hadn’t actually given it much thought. The old sign had said, “Café Bar” and looked very homemade. The new one actually said, “Dumbo General Store.” In my mind, this was an improvement since it actually let people know where they were. And I said as much.</p>
<p>Upon reading <a href=""http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/29/32_29_mm_dumbo_general_store.html"" target=""_blank"">the ensuing article</a>, I saw that my point of view was in the minority. Most regulars liked the homespun feel of the original and appreciated that it felt like a secret they were in on. One of the designers here much prefers the old sign. And it’s true that it was more aesthetically pleasing than the new one (but let’s face it—responses to aesthetics are subjective).</p>
<p>At Big Duck we see this kind of resistance with some regularity. Changes in color palette, logos, taglines, messaging—these things can represent major shifts for organizations. Board members and staff have gotten involved for reasons that existed before we came along. So when we recommend overhauling how the organization presents itself, there’s understandable resistance. “It was good enough for me; it should be good enough for anyone.”</p>
<p>I unwittingly walked into the middle of the same resistance at the Dumbo General Store. I understand that people enjoy feeling like a member of the club. Locals don’t want their regular haunts to be overrun by outsiders. There are plenty of places I’ve stopped going to over the years because they got too crowded.</p>
<p>But you know what? The General Store is a business. They want customers. Customers need to know where to go. No matter how the sign actually looks (I think it’s pretty decent, actually, if a bit too like a chain café), it’s doing its job. Which is exactly how I was quoted in the article.</p>
<p>Nonprofits too need to be constantly looking outside of themselves for survival. What you’ve got may be good enough for you, the staff, and even the board. But is your brand doing its job? Is it reaching new donors, new participants, and new advocates? Or does it spend too much time talking to the insiders?</p>
<p>The Dumbo General Store may have been doing a brisk business with its crew of regulars before the sign change. And if the regulars stop going there just because they don’t like the sign, they’re only punishing themselves. My guess is that the regulars will continue to patronize the General Store. The food is good. The coffee is good. The atmosphere is good, even if, when you leave (as our very own Katherine Sciolto seems to think), you smell like beef and cheese.</p>
<p>The new sign will, I suspect, expand the Dumbo General Store’s customer base. Proper communications has that effect on people.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1410%1","","","","who-are-you-serving-anyway","","","",

<ol>
<li>You have a presence across several social media channels and most people on staff get it. There is a clear, accepted understanding of how your organization can use social media to build relationships with various audiences. One or several staff manage it. You may even have a policy in place and have held discussions in staff meetings.</li>
<li>Your staff have personal profiles on various social networks and may even use Twitter or write their own blog. They may occasionally mention your organization, but no one is coordinating how often they post content, thinking about goals for your overall organization, seeking out your supporters, or keeping an eye out being consistent or authentic with whatever is said.</li>
<li>Your boss, executive director or board thinks social media is a waste of time--or don't get it at all. They are afraid to open the door to controversy or think it will distract from other, more worthwhile ways to spend your day. They've conjured up the 'worse case scenario' and can't see beyond it. What they don't realize is that 'scenario' may already exist. In other words, their fears may be that someone will say that you don't provide good services or mismanage your funds or some other negative attack. Truth of the matter is that, people can already write negative things about your on Facebook, Twitter, blogs and on other sites.</li>

<p><br />Do any of these sound like you? Perhaps you are somewhere along the spectrum of how accepted and integrated social media is in your organizational culture. Depending on where you are, the course of action will range from having to convince your colleagues that social media is valuable to pausing to evaluate how well you've been using these tools to connect with your audience.<br /><em>Thinking about creating a social media policy or have one you want to share?

If your messages have to fight through the clutter to be heard, why confuse audiences by changing the color, tagline, or message? What's the value for you in that?

I tried to find the exact source of that stat and found several references, ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 messages daily. This was, incidentally, back in the days before Facebook, Twitter, and other social media reshaped our communication habits. If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that the average American receives at least 3,000 marketing messages daily, but the average wired American or urban American may be receiving closer to 10,000.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1409%1,1066%2,1408%3","","","","information-everywhere","","","",

<p><br />For instance, I know several people who're involved with an environmental organization called Friends of the Earth (link to foe.org). This terrific nonprofit ""champions a healthy and just world"" through environmental advocacy. I love the name Friends of the Earth- who doesn't want to be a part of that?? But the acronym- FOE- is literally the antithesis of their name. Their website is www.foe.org- doesn't sound like a place I'd like to be as an activist.</p>
<p><br />Similarly, I worked on a project a few years ago involving an organization who referred to themselves by their acronym JACAS, which basically sounds like... well... you get it.<br />When organizations are founded or rename themselves, people forget to consider the shorthand and default to the acronym. Why not come up with something more evocative of the work itself? Or just stick with the full name??</p>
<p><br />Acronyms that string together meaningless letters distract from, rather than build, support. <a href=""http://www.acronymfinder.com/"" target=""_blank"">Acronymfinder.com</a> is a handy website that can help you identify other organizations who might use the same acronym you're using.

Within the past few weeks, two of my favorite online resources--<a href=""http://www.npr.org/"" target=""_blank"">NPR</a> and <a href=""http://www.designobserver.com/"" target=""_blank"">Design Observer</a>--have launched major website overhauls. Both sites are run by highly competent and design-savvy organizations, so I was surprised to find that one update turned out to be far more successful than the other.</p>
<p><br />NPR has done everything right. Rethinking a website is no small task, and their team seems to have put great thought into every detail. The result is a cohesive website that not only looks fresh and modern but is actually simpler and more pleasant to use.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />The old NPR website, shown below, overwhelmed visitors with information, and the narrow left-side navigation felt cramped and small. There was simply too much going on.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/4257f8abd00097b4163c8ac11261efb6/files/nprold400.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""300"" width=""400"" /><br />Old NPR site</p>
<p>By contrast, the <a href=""http://www.npr.org/"" target=""_blank"">new NPR site</a> feels spacious and organized. Text throughout is larger, but there's less of it, giving the stories room to ""breathe."" Similarly, the bold navigation bar along the top is far less confusing, grouping content into fewer, more streamlined categories. Changes like these reflect smart decisions about <em>information hierarchy</em>--the way content is arranged and emphasized. Language, color, size, and alignment all work together to establish a clear and understandable structure for the website. Which, in turn, lets visitors more efficiently find their way to the news stories that excite and interest them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/4257f8abd00097b4163c8ac11261efb6/files/nprnew400.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""300"" width=""400"" /><br />New NPR site</p>
<p>Best of all, the new NPR.org incorporates a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/services/new_site/guided-tour.php"" target=""_blank"">guided video tour</a> to explain new features and help visitors acclimate to the redesign.</p>
<p><br />While NPR's web update took it from cluttered to clean, the recent changes to Design Observer have pushed it in the other direction. As a site dedicated to writings on design and culture, you'd expect Design Observer to offer a particularly well-conceived online experience. And there are a number of good things to say about their redesign. But, on the whole, the new site's information hierarchy leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p><br />The old Design Observer, shown below, had a straightforward yet elegant blog structure. Feature articles with large, intriguing images dominated the left side of the page and briefer items, links, and ads were arranged in two understated columns on the right.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/4257f8abd00097b4163c8ac11261efb6/files/doold400.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""300"" width=""400"" /><br />Old Design Observer site</p>
<p><br />Unfortunately, the updated <a href=""http://www.designobserver.com/"" target=""_blank"">Design Observer 3.0</a> has abandoned the clear hierarchy of the original. Granted, the new site is far more content-rich, combining four separate blogs, so some added complexity is to be expected. But complexity doesn't have to mean confusion. And while the old site provided clear cues as to what content was most important, here you're not quite sure where to look first. The navigation in too-small type is easily missed on the far left, while a relatively unimportant twitter feed receives undue emphasis in the second column. The feature content is rather lost in the center, where it competes with an image-heavy and almost equally-sized right-hand column.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/4257f8abd00097b4163c8ac11261efb6/files/donew400.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""300"" width=""400"" /><br />New Design Observer site</p>
<p><br />This is not to say that the new Design Observer website is bad--it actually has a lot going for it. (The dynamic masthead navigation is particularly cool.) But a few tweaks to the arrangement and relative size and weight of the different sections could make it a lot better.</p>

<p><br />The MTA fails commuters going from Queens to Brooklyn or vice versa. I know, I know, there's the G train, but it's a little known fact that Samuel Beckett's original title was actually Waiting for the G. Plus, from my beloved neighborhood, Sunnyside, if I work the G train into my commute, it actually takes three trains instead of two.</p>
<p><br />That's why I make lemonade just about every day. I take the subway to the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge and then hike across it to our office. I cannot overstate the added value of a twice-daily walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p><br />If it's raining I don't walk the Bridge. I also won't walk it on my way to work if it's hotter than 80 degrees when I leave my apartment in the morning. Arriving to work overly drenched in sweat is cruel to colleagues and clients. But other than those exceptions, I walk it.</p>
<p><br />The Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic reminder that yes, I live in a tremendous city. Lower Manhattan looks like a colossus from the Bridge's vantage point, and at night the midtown skyline looks like a theater set. There was one foggy morning that felt like walking through a dream, and a snowy Brooklyn Bridge is about one of the most beautiful sights you'll see.<br />A woman even once passed me a note on the Bridge. Alas, I'm married. But the Brooklyn Bridge is one thing we don't have in Queens, and sometimes I like it so much I feel like I'm cheating on Queens with Brooklyn.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","bridge-not-too-far","","","",

<li>Take a deep breath, and let go. You're not in control anymore.</li>
<li>Stop, look, and listen. Tie your goals to what people need, and meet your audiences where they are.</li>
<li>Build your strategy around reality. Select the tools based on their purpose, your audience, and what you can manage in terms of staff time and costs.</li>
<li>Remember what you learned in kindergarten: be nice, share, and say thank you.</li>
<li>Emphasize the social in social media. Use pictures and videos to share stories. Schedule calls, meetups, and events to connect online communities.</li>
<li>Get personal. Pick the right staff, and let them be themselves.</li>
<li>Be flexible. Your community will move around; the tools are going to change.</li>
<li>Don't forget your website &amp; integration. Bring all your online communications together and repurpose content.</li>
<li>Change how you define success. It's about content rather than numbers; relationship-building rather than ""marketing"".</li>
<li>Pause and evaluate. Keep listening, and give yourself time to build community, trust, and conversation.</li>

Both are organizations that work with kids and thought it'd be a neat way to engage some of their core constituents.</p>","<p>Recently two organizations mentioned to me that they were thinking of having contests--one to come up with a new name, the other to arrive at a logo. Both are organizations that work with kids and thought it'd be a neat way to engage some of their core constituents.</p>
<p><br />I love the idea of engaging clients or program participants in a creative endeavor that can represent the organization. What's more powerful, for instance, than an annual report illustrated with artwork created by kids in its program?</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />In 1996, the Partnership for a <a href=""http://www.drugfree.org/"" target=""_blank"">Drug-Free America</a> hired us to design a book for parents called ""Growing Up Drug-Free: A Parent's Guide to Prevention"". To illustrate the book, we asked kids from very diverse backgrounds to draw their vision of a drug-free world. The drawings were moving and profound: images of clean, safe parks, families smiling and sitting together, and empty prison cells. The drawings were so powerful the guide received a Presidential Design Achievement Award (and I almost got to meet Bill Clinton!).</p>
<p><br />But I must say, the idea of a contest to do something as critical as rename the organization or develop a new logo makes me nervous. While the ideas that will be submitted will, no doubt, be interesting, they will likely lack professionalism or strategy. At best, a creative kid will come up with something brilliant and the many others whose work wasn't selected will be disappointed. At worse, the ideas submitted will be unusable and the organization will be in the difficult situation of explaining why they can't use the anything submitted.</p>
<p><br />There's also that 'you get what you pay for' variable in all of this: a volunteer's work (no matter what their level of professionalism or experience) can be hard to direct, particularly on something where refinement may be everything, such as an organization's name or a logo.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/e2d25f0515fb6210330dd7b924ddf729/files/self"" border=""0"" /></p>
<p><br />Young children's self-portraits can speak volumes and help communicate the impact of your work more effectively than words.</p>
<p><br />Instead of using a contest for something as central to your organization's identity as its logo or tagline, consider instead something less competitive and more 'win, win'. Give the folks in your programs an assignment where you can use a large volume of what they produce. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request short poems on a theme such as 'hopes for the future' or 'why I'm glad I participate in this program' and have the submissions designed and printed on a large format printer, like wall paper, then redo your lobby with it.</li>
<li>Request self portraits and frame them in your board room.</li>
<li>Request drawings or writings on 8x11 paper on a theme related to your work and make a book for major donors using color copies of the most inspiring.</li>
<li>Ask for short autobiographies and post them, with images, on your website.</li>
<li>Have clients work collaboratively on a mural for a public room (perhaps your lobby, conference room or programs space) that reflects your mission.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Looking forward to hearing what your organization does.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1,2059%2","","","","contests-winwin","","","",

<p><br />In addition to effectively implementing their mission to build an appreciation of nature at the programmatic level, the Wellfleet Audobon does lots of things well. One of the best examples of in-person communications I've seen recently is the signage in their new buildings. A few years ago, they redid their programs buildings using the latest in green technologies- recycled materials, composting toilets, and more. But rather than describe it only in their newsletters and other member-focused communications, they wove explanations about these items through the spaces themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1ca8e84557c1c306c52484f076270dc0/files/office1"" border=""0"" /><br />Walls painted with recycled paint.</p>

<p><br />Using green circles about a foot in diameter, they tell the stories behind each item in their construction. As you walk through, you can read them or ignore them- but there's no doubt this organization is 'walking the talk' and demonstrating the value of sustainability in this key venue, where most audiences connect with them.</p>

<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/989f5686b3851fdda546f8cfa97b69e9/files/sassubtalk850_300x151.jpg"" border=""0"" height=""151"" width=""300"" /></p>

But this campaign brings out the crank in me without fail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">While it's great news that a new subway line is being constructed, why are you telling me about something I can't benefit from for another 6 years? Secondly, why are you underscoring that it's 'overdue'? This piece of bad news seems to only reflect poorly on the author- it doesn't add anything. Lastly, please don't tell me how to feel (""excellent news"").</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This organization-centric ad was clearly the outgrowth of a staff meeting where nobody stopped to think about how the target audience- regular subway riders like me- might respond. It has no call to action and no immediate benefit or reason to engage me.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So enough of your belly-aching, you say? What's the point, you say? Ok, fine. The take away is this: next time your organization's staff discusses sharing news that's big for you, pause to consider how big it is for your audience. Then think about what you hope they'll do as the result of hearing this news (Donate? Volunteer? Sign a petition?) and what you might need to communicate in order to get them to take that action.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1,2059%2","","","","dont-get-my-hopes-down","","","",

<p>Of the many interesting and important points made over the course of the day, here are a few that I found particularly valuable:</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Get a Facebook page. </strong></h3>
<p>According to Randi Zuckerberg, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>'s Marketing Director, one of the biggest mistakes nonprofits make on Facebook is maintaining a group instead of a page. Having a page lets your organization tap into the networking power of Facebook (more on that in a future post)--groups are an older feature and much less dynamic.That's not to say you should rush out and delete your organization's group right now, but if you have one, you might start thinking about how to coax your users over to your fan page instead. I wouldn't be surprised to see Facebook adding more and more features to fan pages as they let groups become slowly obsolete.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Video is big.</strong></h3>
<p>Video was everywhere at the conference. Nearly all of the presenters showed a cause-related video at some point during their talk—a telling indicator that video is becoming the norm for nonprofits, rather than a rare or unusual communications tool.YouTube now offers a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">free nonprofit program</a> with many premium features, including bigger videos and the opportunity to embed links, so if your nonprofit hasn't signed up yet, you should check it out.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Long live slactivism?</strong></h3>
<p>""Slactivism""--taking action in support of a cause or an idea without even leaving one's chair (like signing a petition online)--has been a hot topic lately, and several of the presenters referred to it in their talks.Is there value to slactivism, and will nonprofits be able to convert their armchair-activists into real-life advocates? It's up for debate, but the consensus seems optimistic that making small connections now may open the door for deeper interactions over time. A <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/giveandtake/article/1235/does-a-new-report-on-volunteering-refute-charges-of-slacktivism"" target=""_blank"">recent study suggests</a> that if young people interact with an organization on social networks, they're more likely to give or volunteer later on.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong></strong>Embrace the real-time revolution.</h3>
<p>In social media, things happen now. Not next week when your direct mail piece arrives in the mailbox; not even in 5 minutes when your enewsletter blasts. Now. Nonprofits active in social media are harnessing that power to their advantage, turning out last-minute calls to Congresspeople, or petitioning Facebook fans for funds to meet an approaching deadline.Livestrong, Lance Armstrong's foundation, shared an anecdote about the power of real-time media: a simple tweet from Lance prompted over 1,200 people to gather in the space of just a few hours for a bike ride through Dublin. Could your nonprofit take advantage of real-time access to donors and activists?</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>It doesn't matter where you are</strong>.</h3>
<p>Several of the presenters pointed out that the rise of online social tools is making a person's physical location ever more irrelevant. A community of individuals affected by a rare disease can gather online, even though they're nowhere near each other in person. Volunteers can contribute their time <a href=""http://www.theextraordinaries.org/"" target=""_blank"">in two-minute increments on their mobile phones</a>. Your neighbor isn't just the person living or working on your street or in your town--it's the person or group whose ideas and activities relate to yours (and your audiences's) online.If you made it to the conference or watched the livestream, are there any other takeaways you'd add?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1412%1","","","","thoughts-summer-social-good","","","",

<p>How specific Vision, Mission, and Values statements look and are used will vary from organization to organization. Below is one example.</p>
<p>Big Duck has been working with the <a href=""http://www.jewishcamp.org/fjc/global/default.asp"" target=""_blank"">Foundation for Jewish Camp</a> for a number of years now, and we helped them develop their Vision, Mission, and Values statements.

<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Foundation for Jewish Camp</strong><br /><strong></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Our Vision </strong></h3>
<p>Summers at Jewish overnight camp turn Jewish youth into spirited and engaged Jewish adults, laying the groundwork for strong Jewish communities. The Foundation for Jewish Camp aspires to elevate the field of Jewish camp, conferring proper recognition and granting appropriate support to expand its impact across our community, so that camp can be a critical element of every Jewish young person's education.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Mission</h3>
<p>The Foundation for Jewish Camp unifies and galvanizes the field of Jewish overnight camp and significantly increases the number of children participating in transformative summers at Jewish camp, assuring a vibrant North American Jewish community.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Core strategies:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increasing awareness about the value of Jewish summer camps to families and communities.</li>
<li>Expanding access to and intensifying demand for local camp programs through communication, outreach, and incentive/scholarship programs.</li>
<li>Providing vital resources and cutting-edge strategies to enable the field to better serve campers and increase market share.</li>
<li>Developing capacity by nurturing and creating new camp initiatives, models, and programs.</li>
<li>Advocating to Jewish organizations, foundations, and thought-leaders on behalf of the field of Jewish camping.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Our Values</h3>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br /><br />We operationalize our goals into measurable objectives, and we gauge our success through impact and accomplishments.<br /><strong><br />Integrity:</strong><br /><br />We integrate best practices in our daily work and conduct ourselves ethically, respectfully, consistently, and transparently in all of our activities and relationships.<br /><strong><br />Respect:</strong><br /><br />We embrace inclusiveness and respect the many approaches, ideologies, ethnicities, and denominations that make up our community.<br /><strong><br />Responsive leadership:</strong><br /><br />We identify emerging needs and opportunities and proactively develop new strategies to address the challenges facing the field.<br /><strong><br />Independence:</strong><br /><br />We function outside the influence of a single point-of-view and make objective decisions that encourage each camp to thrive on its own terms.<br /><strong><br />Optimism:</strong></p>

<p>Anyway... We've gotten a lot of feedback over the years -- some good, some bad. Good feedback makes all the difference in getting to that final place of mutual creative satisfaction. It helps us, and any creative team, get to a stronger result. Bad feedback can either impede us completely or, in a best-case scenario, just leave us hanging to figure it all out for ourselves.</p>
<p>So how do you get the best work out of writers, designers, and other freelancers? We'll get into some details about feedback in the forthcoming posts, but here are two opening points to keep in mind as you read this blog series:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creativity is a two-way street.</strong> You need the creative minds and talent that come with a writer, designer, or other freelancer. If you could do it yourself, you almost certainly would. Likewise, these creative people need you. You know your organization inside and out, and they need you to offer clear direction from your unique point-of-view.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback is part of a larger conversation about process.</strong> Collaboration takes effort. The first thing you can do to get things off on the right foot is to prepare carefully. (Preparation is the topic for the next post.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal with this series is to help you navigate the creative process, which goes hand-in-hand with navigating creative people. We aren't that different from other people most of the time, but we do have our quirks. The two of us are now old enough to admit this about ourselves. But like you, we creative types also take our work very seriously, even when it looks like a lot of fun. And whatever the project, we're all in it together.</p>
<p>So keep your eyes peeled to the Duck Call for forthcoming posts in the <a href=""/feedback-doesnt-screech-through-loudspeakersepisode-ii-be-preppie-or-least-prepared""><i>Feedback That Doesn't Screech Through the Loudspeakers</i></a> series.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1416%1,1415%2","","","","feedback-doesnt-screech-through-loudspeakersepisode-i-we-need-each-other-wall-street-an","feedback","","",

<li>Do you tend to look at your nonprofit's website analytics through a microscope when a magnifying glass would do the trick? Here's a <a href=""http://nten.org/blog/2009/04/16/five-step-program-measure-effectiveness-your-web-pages?utm_source=Not-For-Profit+News&amp;utm_campaign=a5017dde18-NFP+News+Sep09&amp;utm_medium=email"" target=""_blank"">thoughtful post from NTEN</a> with tips for honing in on the most important aspects of your web traffic data, so you can be confident that you're seeing the forest as well as the trees.</li>
<li>If your nonprofit's Facebook page activity is occasional at best, make the most out of those rare status updates by posting on a Tuesday or a Wednesday. According to <a href=""http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/allfacebook/~3/pjKn32n1n9o/"" target=""_blank"">a recent report</a>, these two days boast the highest average click-through rates, with a precipitous drop on Thursday.

<p>This is a series about feedback, but it's also a part of a larger conversation about process. Any feedback relates directly to the goals of a project.<br /><br />At Big Duck, we begin any big project with what we call a <a href=""http://www.adcracker.com/brief/sample-creative-brief.htm"" target=""_blank"">project brief</a>. It is a simple document that lays out what you hope to accomplish with the assignment and any parameters related to the project. The strategic and creative teams at Big Duck rely on the project brief to guide our thinking, our brainstorming, our sketching, and even the whining that inevitably accompanies our creative struggles associated with any project.</p>
<p>The project brief is your voice in the process and keeps writers and designers from working in a vacuum. Trust us: you don't want to see what happens to the creative work when we're in a vacuum. A little bit of anchoring in the real world is a Very Good Thing for us creative types.<br /><br />If you're not working with Big Duck or an agency that puts together a project brief, we strongly suggest that you do something similar for your work with freelancers. It will save oodles of misunderstanding, hard feelings, and money.<br /><br />Having your own project brief provides context for the project (why this annual report, for example, and why now); parameters (e.g. how many concepts, how many drafts, etc.); goals for the project (what you hope to accomplish); target audiences (who you want to inspire to take what action); definition of success (what metrics you will compare the final project and its outcomes against); tone and style (how it should feel); guidelines for copy (what words to avoid, etc.) and visuals (what parts of your current brand are non-negotiable, available artwork, etc.); and a schedule (what's due when).<br /><br />The best part about having a project brief is that it then serves as the guide for your feedback and discussion with the creative team. If everything is well defined up front and you feel good about the thinking behind the project, you have something tangible against which to judge the creative work. This helps keep the conversation objective, rather than subjective. We will, of course, say more about this later.<br /><br />Two other things are helpful to include in the project brief: positioning and personality. Having these two things defined help keep your thinking about the creative work objective. If these are new concepts to you, we suggest looking into them. They are topics too large to discuss in a blog post about feedback, even a series such as this one. Al Ries and Jack Trout's seminal book on the subject (conveniently titled <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Mind-Anniversary/dp/0071359168/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253106546&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Positioning</a>) will help you get started.<br /><br />The upfront work you do with the project brief (and your positioning/personality) will ultimately save your organization a lot of headaches. We creative types can bring you a lot of headaches anyway with our quirky behavior and finicky emotions, so think of a project brief as a dose of preventative ibuprofen for your collaboration.<br /><br />What happened last time you jumped right into the project's creative work without planning ahead? How'd it go?<br /><br /><strong>Next time on Feedback that Doesn't Screech Through the Loudspeakers... What do realism, respect, and honesty have to do with all of this? Lots!

<p>Welcome back to our series about feedback.

Otherwise, read on...<br /><br />If you've ever worked on a fundraising campaign or a website redesign or any other activity that requires either a creative agency or freelance designers and copywriters, you've probably seen a lot of work you hated. We hope that you've also seen a lot of work with which you've been thrilled.<br /><br />But you probably know first-hand that getting there can be difficult, especially when dealing with the ""quirks of the creative personality."" (We can say that because we're ""creatives,"" as we're called in the biz. We wouldn't recommend discussing the quirks of the creative personality directly with creatives with quirky personalities.)<br /><br />How then do you work with these creatives (who so unabashedly turn a perfectly good adjective into a noun)? How do you make sure they have everything they need to produce the quality of work you require, without inadvertently getting them to take their concepts and go home, leaving only a wake of profanity behind them?<br /><br />There are three simple tenets you should keep in mind when working with creatives, and you should let them guide not only your responses but also your attitude:<br /><strong><br /></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be realistic.</strong> It's pretty rare that a writer or designer will hit it out of the park the first time (although it does happen from time to time), so come to the meeting with tempered expectations. Excitement is fine and encouraged, as long as your excitement isn't also setting you up for inevitable disappointment. Also, the chances are good, especially if you're dealing with a brand overhaul (new logo, tagline, etc.), that you've been thinking about this for months, if not years. The creative team has only had a few weeks at most.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Assume we creatives are a moody, oversensitive bunch of ninnies. Even if your freelancer has super thick skin, you'll score a lot of points for sensitive feedback, if you stay positive and kind. We also like it when you consider us an extension of your team. We take ownership of the work we do and get excited about it. Our goal is to make you shine. So we spend hours thinking, debating, sketching, discussing, brainstorming, scribbling down random thoughts, writing, whining, designing.</li>
<li><strong>Be honest.</strong> Even if we're a bit touchy and oversensitive, we can take honesty. If we couldn't we wouldn't be in this business. Be frank about what you think. In fact, we prefer frankness. Just don't be a big ol' meanie, please. You want good results and so do we; let's play like a team.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Learn and live these three simple tenets before you see any creative work. It will make your collaboration a much happier affair.<br /><br /><strong>Coming up next time on Feedback that Doesn't Screech Through the Loudspeakers... You hate the work. Now what?</strong></p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1415%1,1416%2","","","","eedback-doesnt-screech-through-loudspeakersepisode-iii-not-tenants-or-tennis-tenets","feedback","","",

<p>We Ducks are proud to announce that one of our integrated fundraising campaigns has won an award from <a href=""http://www.fundraisingsuccessmag.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>FundRaising Success</em> magazine</a>! We learned earlier this month that the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy 2008 Year-End Appeal tied for the bronze in the Multichannel category. <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a> (PPMD) is a long-time client of Big Duck, and they work to end Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal genetic disorder that affects boys. The 2008 year-end appeal combined print and online elements and built on the momentum of a very successful integrated year-end campaign that we developed for PPMD in 2007.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, one of the biggest questions we had going into the 2008 campaign was what effect the foundering economy would have on the results. Matching or bettering the previous year's success was probably unrealistic, but could we keep the difference small or possibly avoid a decline altogether?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Crafting the campaign</h3>
<p>We started by creating an overarching concept--""Let's create more milestones together""--that we applied to a print piece and a series of five emails. Since boys with Duchenne generally survive only until their late twenties or early thirties, reaching life's milestones is an emotional topic for parents and families. The direct mail card dropped before Thanksgiving, the email series began that same week with a cultivation message. Three fundraising appeals followed over the month of December, and the series wrapped up with a thank-you message in early January. The imagery used in the campaign included a moving picture of a mother and her son with Duchenne and a timeline of major life milestones.</p>

<p>Over the course of the holiday season, we tied the campaign appeal to other aspects of PPMD's online experience: banners on their website; integration with <a href=""http://community.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">PPMD's community site</a>; a splash page, live for a week in December in place of the usual homepage; unique donation landing pages; and promotion in PPMD's monthly eNewsletter.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">How did we do?</h3>
<p>Overall, while we didn't manage to buck the trend of declining fundraising returns across the nonprofit sector, we were heartened to see a relatively minimal decline from 2007.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raised nearly $350,000 (an 11% decline from last year's total), of which 18% came in online</li>
<li>Average gift was $586.39, representing over a 17% increase from the year before</li>
<li>89 new online donors</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2008 campaign garnered fewer gifts than the previous year's, but it successfully motivated PPMD's core constituency and inspired them to give as generously as they could, even in the face of tough times. We were also pleased to find that PPMD's emails, which usually perform better than industry standards in terms of open and click-through rates, continued to perform well throughout the 2008 year-end appeal--an indication of their community's continued interest in engaging with and hearing from them. Thanks to <em>FundRaising Success</em> for the award, and congratulations to Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy on another award-winning fundraising effort.</p>

<p>We're sure that, if you've picked the right creative team, what they present to you will be glorious. That's certainly true if you're dealing with work done by the two of us. We're tremendous. But what if it's not? What can you do to keep from pissing off these temperamental weirdos, sitting so expectantly in front of you with their precious, precious work?</p>
<p><br />You already live the three tenets explained in our <a href=""/blog/feedback-doesnt-screech-through-loudspeakersepisode-iii-not-tenants-or-tennis-tenets"" target=""_blank"">previous post</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your expectations are realistic.</li>
<li>You respect the talent before you.</li>
<li>You've been honest to this point and will continue to be so.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good. Well done. Now the specifics. Here are a few recommendations to help guide a productive discussion:<br /><strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the good.</strong> Even if you're disappointed overall with what you're looking at, try to find something positive to start with. State it. If there are a lot of positive things to say, say them. Creatives like having their fragile egos stroked, it sets a collaborative tone, and it keeps the meeting positive.</li>
<li><strong>Think objectively, not subjectively.</strong> Judge the work sitting in front of you based on the goals outlined before creative work began. Refer back to the project brief. This helps keep the conversation objective. ""Red reminds me of pigeon blood"" is not actually a relevant comment because red won't remind most people of pigeon blood.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the why.</strong> Comments such as, ""I like it"" or ""I don't like it"" aren't helpful because they don't educate the creative team. Get in the habit of saying, ""I like it because..."" and ""I don't like it because..."". (Fill in the blanks, too, please.) The interesting, and most useful, part of any conversation is always in the why.</li>
<li><strong>Defer to the experts.</strong> By all means, point out your concerns, but try to avoid offering solutions. Although you're the expert about the organization, a writer might find a new way to tell your story, and a designer may express your organization in ways you've probably never thought of. Once you state the concern, let the creatives come up with the solutions--or propose your ideas but leave room for alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid ""Frankensteining.""</strong> This is related to the point immediately above. Elements from concept 1 and concept 2 can't necessarily be combined effectively.<br /><br />An overheard example of Frankensteining: ""I like how the donation button in design #1 is red, which calls a lot of attention to it. But I like design #2 better overall. So just make that donation button red."" Some things cannot be interchanged. Red might clash with the colors of design #2. Instead, consider this approach:<br /><br />""I like how design #1 calls out attention to the donation button. Is there something you can do to design #2 to make the donation button more prominent?""</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep the roles clearly defined in the project. Offer thoughtful, respectful feedback. If you play your cards right, you'll end up with an unexpected--and successful--final project.</p>
<p>And hey, after it's all over, you might even still be able to have a friendly drink with the creative team.</p>
<p>Of course, as we stated in the first post of this series, the two of us aren't actually physically able to drink alcohol. But we really like coffee. And barbecue. Not necessarily together.</p>
<p><br /><strong>And this concludes the series Feedback that Doesn't Screech Through the Loudspeakers! Do you have any horror stories about working with creatives? What about any romantic comedies or coming-of-age stories? We'd like to hear them all.</strong></p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1416%1,1415%2","","","","feedback-doesnt-screech-through-loudspeakersepisode-iv-new-hope","feedback","","",

<p>A few weeks back, I had a disappointing online interaction with a nonprofit, and I think it serves as a cautionary tale about creating too many barriers to signup or participation online.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>About two years ago, I connected with a nonprofit online to buy an event ticket, and in the process, I gave them my email address. Since the ticket purchase, I've gotten occasional updates and campaign fundraising emails, but all things considered, they've been very respectful of my information and haven't abused the privilege. It seems they're employing a good segmentation strategy--they know I'm not closely connected to their mission, so they just let me sit quietly on their list and send me the occasional update.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I got a very simple, straightforward email inviting me to sign up for their weekly enewsletter. They made a good case for why I might be interested--upcoming events, special offers--and I thought, ""Hey, they've shown themselves to be good communicators so far, and their newsletter looks interesting--I guess I'd be willing to hear from them more often."" And I clicked ""Subscribe"".</p>
<p>Up to this point, I'd say this organization did a stellar job communicating with me. Once they'd built my trust, they piqued my interest in connecting more deeply by pointing out what's in it for me, instead of focusing on what's in it for them. Signing up for a weekly enewsletter might not seem like a big step, but it puts me one rung higher on the engagement ladder--I'm now a bit more interested in what they do, a bit more aware of what's going on, a bit more likely to give come year-end. Bravo to them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cheers stopped there. The ""Subscribe"" button took me to a page on their website, where I entered my name and email address. Done, right? Wrong. A screen popped up, asking for a username and password (probably something I created two years ago while buying a ticket in what I thought would be a one-time interaction). After a few failed login attempts, I was directed to a re-registration form that required all my contact information: phone, mailing address, the works.</p>
<p>I gave up. All I wanted to do was join their email list, and it should have been one-click-simple. Instead, they lost a subscriber, and maybe even a donor down the line.</p>
<p>It was a smart call-to-action and a good use of their email list. But the signup process was too much of a barrier--either they were too eager to collect as much information as possible without considering the user's experience, or their constituent relationship management solution wasn't flexible enough to accommodate a simple email signup.</p>
<p>For the record, I tried again and decided to share all of my information so I could sign up. But not every site visitor will come back after a difficult first experience, and a long signup process can undermine even a great, engaging call-to-action. Is your nonprofit making it as easy as possible for new audiences to participate online, or are you losing opportunities?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1,1408%2","","","","clever-cultivation-stumbles-finish-line","","","",

<p>A little while ago, we got a question from a client about Twitter. They have the basics down pat: they know the lingo, and they understand the importance of conversation. But they were curious about what kind of content they should tweet, and how to strike the right balance between carrying on conversation and self-promotion. It's a good question, and it got me thinking about the kind of content nonprofits might want to share on Twitter on a day-to-day basis, and how an organization can get the most out of microblogging.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: this post assumes some familiarity with Twitter, so if you need an overview first, skip down to the links at the bottom for some Twitter 101.)</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Reaching your goals online: a balancing act.</strong></h3>
<p>Hopefully, if your nonprofit is getting started on Twitter, you've identified some goals you're hoping to reach: raising awareness of your issue, connecting with current constituents, gaining followers and encouraging them to take action or donate, etc. Whatever your goals may be, it's likely that you'll need to do at least some talking about your organization and the work you're doing in order to achieve them. But wait--I thought Twitter was all about conversation and making authentic connections. How can my nonprofit talk about itself without being too self-promotional and driving followers away? I have two words for you: balance and value. Strive to create a helpful balance between information about your organization and content that has value for your audience. Ideally, you can deliver both at once.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Give your followers what they want.</h3>
<p>It's not easy to offer value, and it's especially hard in 140 characters or fewer. But while your followers may have interest in hearing about your programs occasionally, they'll likely be looking for a more compelling reason to keep an eye on your updates. What do you have to offer that they want or need? Below are a few ideas to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link to relevant news stories or blog posts</strong>. Odds are, if your followers are interested in your organization, they feel strongly about your issue and would welcome information that you identify as interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Ask thought-provoking questions</strong>, ideally ones that relate to your issue. Consider setting up a weekly yes-or-no poll question that you send out every Thursday, or leave it open-ended and invite followers to message you with their replies.</li>
<li><strong>Retweet others</strong>. Used strategically, retweets can be a simple way to share useful/fun/relevant information and promote conversation at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Recommend other individuals or groups to follow</strong>. In combination with retweeting, this tells your followers that your updates are worth following, because you're constantly giving them new reasons to check back.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Share; don't self-promote.</strong></h3>
<p>Giving your followers what they want is great, but you still have tangible goals to keep in mind. Once you've figured out what you can offer value, how can you talk about your work without talking about your work? I've thrown out some ideas below--feel free to add others in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General updates about your programs and events</strong>: ""Our workshop season starts today! Learn more or sign up""</li>
<li><strong>Casual/conversational mentions of your work</strong>: ""Just wrapped up a great event with our wonderful volunteers! See pictures on our Flickr stream""</li>
<li><strong>Facts or stats that your audience might find interesting</strong>: ""X% of Americans are affected by Y every year. Click here to learn more""</li>
<li><strong>A simple call to action</strong>: ""Click here to sign our petition""</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Eeek. All of this sounds like a lot of work.</h3>
<p>It sure can be. But if you're hoping to cultivate an interactive, conversational, meaningful community on Twitter, there's a lot of work involved. Someone at your organization will need to search for and identify content to share and retweet, or come up with questions or tidbits that might be interesting to your followers, and someone will have to make sure all that stuff is posted, questions or comments are answered, followers or retweeters are thanked...the list goes on. If this feels overwhelming, keep in mind that Twitter may not be quite right for your organization at this point. Perhaps building and cultivating the kind of community you want would take more time than you have, which means that now isn't the right moment to dive in. Or perhaps you're already doing everything that you have time for on Twitter, and it isn't generating the kind of interest and buzz that you want, in which case, it's not worthwhile. Be prepared to be flexible and change your approach once you see what works and what doesn't. How does your organization strike the balance between conversation and self-promotion? Do you have suggestions for types of tweets a nonprofit organization might consider? Please share in the comments.

To be more specific, what percentage of your fundraising, programs, or advocacy communications are you doing through your website, email and social media channels? The answer, I suspect, is more and more.<br /><br /></p>","<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/354632a7c53f05678c2bcd33ebe51943/files/nmfa"" border=""0"" /><br />National Military Family of the Year site</p>
<p><br />How much of your organization's communications are happening online at this point? To be more specific, what percentage of your fundraising, programs, or advocacy communications are you doing through your website, email and social media channels? The answer, I suspect, is more and more.</p>
<p>So what about that logo that was developed 25 years ago that looks, um, less than stellar online? Or the inconsistent messages and language on your website?</p>
<p>Lots of organizations are trying to rebrand themselves simultaneously as they build new websites, create integrated outreach or fundraising campaigns, or even as they launch new social media platforms. We regularly hear organizations say things like, 'we need to redo our brand for this site', linking the organization's overall visual identity and messaging to its most important channel: online.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />While I applaud the 'kill two birds with one stone' mentality that often drives this point of view, I must admit, I'm not a fan. Here's why: Your brand is bigger than your website.</p>
<p>An effective brand must also work in person, in print, face-to-face, perhaps even on a cell phone- or in whatever new communications vehicles are around the corner. If done right, the development of your visual identity and messaging platform (the two core components of a brand) should grow out of your vision, mission, and values as an organization. This means the branding process might take some time and involve work that happens long before wireframes or web pages can be developed.</p>
<p>Tackling branding first slows down a web development process, which can make staff and board members nervous, and appears to inflate costs (but really it's just that you're doing two big projects under one job called 'web'). Also, there are a handful of folks who have the talent to both develop a logo and design a great website- but not many. Why not hire the best folks for the brand work then the best folks for the web work?</p>
<p>Instead of rebranding your organization through a process that focuses on a web 'deliverable', why not unbundle the projects? First, develop a clear, effective visual identity and messaging platform that reflects your vision, mission and values well across all channels, tools and technologies. Get your staff and board to participate in the process- and develop something you'll be able to stand behind for years, working with the best folks for the job. Then, build those visuals and messages into whatever you create- online or off.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1,2063%2","","","","your-online-brand","","","",

<p>There were lots of good gems shared and discussed. While most of it was not particularly new for those of us who have been following, studying, working in social media for nonprofits, it all bears repeating. This is still such a new field.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/919628e01ac72e08af30c5541b5a22ab/files/tweet"" border=""0"" /><small><br />(L to R) Kyra Gaunt (@kyraocity) speaking, with Allison Fine (@afine), Andrew Rasiej (@rasiej) and Deanna Zandt (@randomdeanna). Oh, and that woman typing away on the right in the audience is me (@farra)--tweeting it up.</small></p>
<p>Here are a few takeaways I wanted to share with you, oh loyal fans of the Duck Call Blog:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You are an adult now -- it's okay to talk to strangers.</strong> Panel moderator <a href=""http://anthropology1001.blogspot.com/"" target=""new"">Dr. Kyra Gaunt</a> set the stage by reminding us to forget what we learned as kids. Social media -- and in particular Twitter -- is great for talking to strangers. You can learn new ideas and share resources with people around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Take the walls down and embrace a 'social culture'.</strong> Allison reminded attendees that social media tools are just that. If you want to create change, your organization needs to shift how it thinks about social media--from a mindset of fear and control to one of listening and sharing. Several times she said we need to 'tear down the walls' <span><span id=""msgtxt4999662963"">and allow the lines to blur between what happens internally and externally.&nbsp; Having a <a href=""http://afine2.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/creating-a-social-culture/"" target=""_blank"">social culture</a> is about opening up and sharing; letting go of the content and giving more credit than you take. </span></span></li>
<li><span><span><strong>The Internet is not an ATM. Success is about building relationships--not building numbers. </strong>For those people and orgs particularly interesting in <a href=""http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/04/hello-washington-post-dolllars-per-facebook-donor-is-not-the-right-metric-for-success.html"" target=""_blank"">raising money via social media</a>, Deanna shared a helpful way to think about this: Just like you can't walk into a bar, say how awesome you are and then ask someone for money... you can't expect people to give you money, hand over fist, via Facebook and other social media sites. You have to build relationships and follow the tried and true practices of fundraising -- the same ones that have been around since before the web -- share your story, interest the potential donor by giving them something to do other than donating (cultivation), share more about your work and invite them to see your programs in action (stewardship), and then ask them to join you/invest/donate (solicitation). </span></span></li>
<li><span><span><strong>Being everywhere is nice, being relevant is best. </strong>Andrew spoke about the huge access the Internet offers -- citing stats from <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15520.html"" target=""_blank"">how the presidential candidates used social media in the 2008 election</a>. </span></span><span><span id=""msgtxt5000054976"">Where radio, TV, and print are economies of scarcity, he said the Internet is an economy of abundance. </span></span><span><span id=""msgtxt5000076035"">Deanna asked a great question in response, ""How do we move from abundance to being relevant? How do we make info relevant and interesting in people's lives?"" I think this is one of the most important questions to ask and consider right now. </span></span></li>
<li><span><span id=""msgtxt4999662963""><strong>Logos don't talk, people do.</strong> Another hot question at this seminar and others on nonprofits + social media is about walking the line between your professional and personal brand, especially if you are the one tweeting, blogging, status-updating, commenting, texting, etc. for your organization. Allison made a great point in response to this topic and reiterated her earlier comments about taking down the walls and letting it blend.&nbsp; People want to talk to other people. ""</span></span>Social media is not a spectator sport--it's a contact sport."" If you are not sure if social media is for you, start small and experiment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next seminar from Baruch College will focus on 'going mobile' on November 12, 2009.

<!--break-->
<p><br />This book demystifies the process of writing grants in less than 200 pages. It explains how to use storytelling to write creative, compelling grants, while outlining a smart approach to do so. Clarke lays out useful rules of thumb on topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to determine if your organization has a good shot of getting support from a grantmaker</li>
<li>How to write a compelling letter of intent</li>
<li>How to set up the elements of a successful story arc in your proposal, including characters, conflict, and resolution</li>
<li>How to use budgeting to reinforce your story</li>
<li>The difference between goals and objectives, and how to integrate your objectives with outcomes and impacts, which are often the focus of grantmakers' evaluation criteria</li>
<li>Using headings, bullets, timelines and back up documents to make your proposals easier to read and use</li>
<li>Why you should never send your grant to a funder in a binder (who knew?)</li>
<li>How to follow up, and what to do if they don't fund your proposal</li>
</ul>

<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, Cheryl and I have the same publisher (<a href=""http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/"" target=""_blank"">Jossey-Bass</a>), and she reviewed my upcoming book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brandraising-Nonprofits-Visibility-Through-Communications/dp/0470527536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1256241873&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">""Brandraising: How Nonprofits Raise Visibility and Money through Smart Communications""</a> .

<p>If you watch the commercial today, it's wholly unremarkable. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to recall it a few minutes later if you'd never seen it. But for those of us who grew up watching TV during this era, the ad's trite dialogue is seared into our memory. Why? Because during the 1970s and 80s you could count the number of TV stations on your fingers even faster than you could adjust your rabbit ear antennas, and that commercial played constantly. (In fact, I bought Connect Four recently as a gift for a kid- and I could hear that line of bad dialogue echoing in my ears as I clicked 'purchase' online.)</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Yep, whoever bought air time for Connect Four understood the principle of effective frequency- they knew that we consumers needed to see that ad over and over and over and over again until Connect Four became a part of our collective unconscious. These days, reaching effective frequency is much tougher, of course. Given all the tv channels, online destinations, games and virtual worlds consumers now populate, a commercial this mundane could never be viewed enough times to reach effective frequency. It's hardly worth advertising Connect Four at all.The difficulty of reaching the right audiences and the expense of achieving an effective frequency (and a few other things) has made me skeptical about the value of advertising, especially for nonprofits. Many organizations get solicited to advertise in various publications or online forums and consider it simply because they were asked- not because there's a clear strategy that suggests advertising will be effective.Before you consider advertising, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are we trying to reach? Is the most effective channel to reach our audience through?</li>
<li>If it is the most effective way to reach our target audience, what's the action we hope they'll take when they see our ad? What percentage of people reached will be likely are they to take that action as a result of the ad?</li>
<li>Can we afford to run the ad frequently enough to reach an effective frequency and penetrate through the clutter?</li>
</ol>
<p>Advertising as a medium for fundraising rarely works. It's likely to be more viable for programs-related marketing (aka 'outreach') when a specific audience is targeted and the 'call to action' is beneficial for them, as was the case in this bus ad Big Duck developed for <a href=""http://www.sco.org/"" target=""_blank"">SCO Family of Service's Brooklyn Drop-In Center</a>, which ran for about a month on Brooklyn buses. Organizations have raised awareness, changed perceptions, and impacted public health and safety issues like drunk driving and safe sex quite effectively, though- when advertising is part of an overall strategy that's well-considered in advance.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","pretty-sneaky-sis","","","",

<blockquote>On November 14, in honor of our troops, the University of South Carolina Gamecocks and University of Maryland Terrapins will wear specially designed head-to-toe uniforms for their Game Day match-ups versus the University of Florida Gators and Virginia Tech Hokies respectively. The teams will take the field in black and desert camouflage uniforms featuring the Wounded Warrior Project logo. The uniforms will also have a unique twist; a core value embellishment - Duty, Honor, Courage, Commitment, Integrity, Country, and Service - will replace the players' last name on the back of each jersey. Both games will be nationally televised.</blockquote>
<p><!--break--> In addition to seeing this as a worthy example of cause-related marketing, I think this is a great story of an organization that lives its values. In our <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">brandraising</a> projects, we often get into analyzing and helping organization's write their core values. A good set of core values speaks to the staff and board---resonating with the philosophical reasons why you work for the organization and connecting to the joy you feel with your association. While the programs and activities may change over time, the values usually stay the same. They get posted in offices, on websites, and now, well, on football jerseys. <em>What about your organization's values?

<!--break-->
<p><br />Think about your favorite nonprofit and why you support it. Odds are, it isn't just because it has a well-written mission statement. Successful nonprofits realized long ago that no matter how important their causes, donors don't connect to abstract needs. Instead, nonprofits share stories and pictures of people whose lives are made better by the work they do and how that work is made possible by your financial support. Good storytelling is at the heart of successful donor relationships.</p>
<p>Nonprofits need to remember this fundamental truth as they expand their donor communications to online channels. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the myriad of online options - email, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, et al - and learning the technical aspects of how they work. But what is often forgotten along the way is that each of these is simply a tool just like direct mail and phone solicitations. What's important is to focus on the story and adapt it to each channel.</p>
<p>Does this scenario sound familiar? Development sends a letter, the program staff posted a video of their latest project, and the intern has started a Twitter account. Donors may see the output of all three, but without a unified story the result is a disjointed approach that often leaves them confused at best, annoyed at worst. To avoid this a consistent story must be told across all donor touch points. This presents a wonderful opportunity because every time a donor interacts with your organization it is a chance to share another aspect of your story and reiterate the work they make possible.</p>
<p>If your organization currently doesn't have a unified story it's not too late to start. In fact, with the end of the year quickly approaching this may be the best time. Because many people make their annual contribution at the last-minute a unified appeal on December 30 may be just the tickler they need to make a gift.<br /><em><strong></strong></em></p>

<p>Most of us work in the nonprofit world because we want to do some good. We'd like to leave our particular part of the earth a little better than the way we found it. Sometimes this feels like a higher calling. Indeed, for some religious organizations, it actually <em>is</em> a higher calling.</p>
<p><br />In other words, we're saving the world. There: I said it.</p>
<p><br />The residency itself fell through (some sort of health emergency forced its closing for the season--a week before my arrival), but since I'd already made all of the other arrangements that go with taking a month off from one's life, I scrambled, and thanks to a friend, a couple of farmers in Wisconsin offered me their otherwise unused cabin for the month.</p>
<p><br />October turned out to be a less than ideal time to go away work-wise. Three of my fellow Ducks were getting married, so nearly half of the staff would be in and out at different times during the month. But we'd planned well enough ahead (I was accepted to the program in May), and let's face it: there's never really a good time to get away.</p>
<p><br />Nonprofit staffs are notoriously overworked and underpaid, and if someone takes a sabbatical or even a vacation, that work just doesn't get done. That client doesn't get counseling. That grant application gets ignored. That Facebook page doesn't get updated.</p>
<p><br />And if you're an ED, you probably haven't had a vacation in years--at least not a vacation that didn't also include an enormous amount of regular contact with staff and/or clientele to make sure the organization doesn't burn down while you're away.</p>
<p><br />Hey, nonprofiteers! Take some time off!</p>
<p><br />I headed off on my sabbatical with a plan, and it included a lot of work, frankly. It wasn't really my intention to rest. I had a month to get everything done I wanted to get done. My plan seemed ambitious but realistic, and a month flies by before you know it.</p>
<p><br />Because I wanted to be at my most productive, I decided to follow my own natural rhythms. When I felt like writing I'd write; when I felt like eating I'd eat; when I felt like walking I'd walk; and when I felt like sleeping I'd sleep. Rather than ""create on demand,"" which is what we creatives do at Big Duck, I opted to trust that I would physically feel like writing, probably even every day, as long as I paid attention to my needs at any given moment.</p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/b65385deb50cdcbde5c8af6d36603987/files/sunset"" border=""0"" /><br />Waking with the sun has some real advantages.</p>
<p><br />Although the month breezed by, daily life itself slowed down. Each day was its own adventure. I wrote handwritten letters to friends with whom I traded letters before the days of email (I'm showing my age now). Most of them even wrote me back (getting a handwritten letter is still a thrill). I ventured to the main farmhouse once a day to check email and connect with the outside world just a bit (as much as possible I kept my online activity limited to getting baseball scores--I mean, come on, it was the playoffs). Through some kind of miracle, I had cell phone reception, so I kept in regular touch with my wife (we are, after all, married, and we like each other quite a lot).</p>
<p><br />My fine colleagues at Big Duck were kind enough to leave me alone and give me the space I requested to live my month of solitude. There were times I was tempted to check in, but I resisted the urge.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/b65385deb50cdcbde5c8af6d36603987/files/ducks"" border=""0"" /><br />I was inspired to change the Big Duck logo. Good thing I do words, not design.</p>
<p><br />I was fortunate. The Big Duck team was very supportive, and we had an excellent copywriter who was able to be essentially ""on-call"" the whole time I was gone. At home, I have a wife who's equally supportive of my various writing projects (and in that case, no other husband was required to be ""on-call"" during my absence). We also have no children, which makes the logistics of getting away (alone) easier.</p>
<p><br />I just wrote. Or ate. Or walked. Or slept. Or read. Or did nothing.</p>
<p><br />Creative writing restores me. But more important than the writing was the rejuvenation of living in my natural rhythm, something I couldn't have gotten to know without the extended time off.</p>
<p><br />So plan ahead. Take that long vacation. Try to swing some extended leave. Why should academics be the only ones to enjoy sabbaticals?</p>
<p><br />Find a beach. Head for the mountains. Get in the car and drive. Read a stack of detective novels. Write some poetry. Break out the watercolors. Practice the mandolin. Experiment with some complicated recipes. Borrow DVDs from all your friends and figure out why everyone loves <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. Stop showering. Meditate. Do yoga. Go somewhere--anywhere--without any plan at all and find out what happens when you're left alone with your thoughts.</p>
<p><br />In our desire to make the world a better place, it becomes easy to put off the care we need to give ourselves. Your organization's mission is vital and can be all-consuming. But remember: you are vital to your organization's mission. For your organization to succeed, you need to find some balance.</p>
<p><br />I got more done on my writing project than I thought possible--way beyond what I considered both ambitious and realistic. And that's why I took the sabbatical.</p>
<p><br />But it was that slow-down, getting in touch with the natural rhythm of my life, that allowed me to come back to Big Duck restored and rejuvenated, ready to do my part in helping our nonprofit clients achieve their life-changing missions.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2088%1,2150%2,2101%3,2101%4,2150%5,2088%6","","","","take-time-smell-roses-and-yourself","","","",

Participants spend time at their own expense to develop creative ideas and present them with no compensation- simply the hope of being awarded the project. This approach is called doing work ""on spec"" because it's speculative in nature.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8db3e017d74e937bde003bb15842bc09/files/race"" border=""0"" /><br />Many agencies race to produce ""spec"" work.</p>
<p><br />For years, the design industry (advertising's upscale sibling) has fought against doing work on spec, and most design firms shun it. Recently I stumbled upon an entire site devoted to the topic. If you're a nonprofit wondering whether it's reasonable to ask agencies you're considering to develop some ideas for you in their proposal, <a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/articles/ten-reasons/"" target=""_blank"">this may even be worth a quick review</a>.</p>
<p><br />Most agencies have clear policies about whether or not they'll do work on spec. Typically established design, PR, or general communications firms won't, whereas younger, hungrier firms might, in order to build their business. Professional associations in the field mostly take positions on this issue, such as <a href=""/contentmgr/www.aiga.org"" target=""_blank"">AIGA</a> - the trade organization most designers belong to, which acknowledges that spec work happens but generally frowns on it in <a href=""http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work"" target=""_blank"">their policy</a>.</p>
<p><br />Most requests for spec work are motivated by a desire to understand what the work will be like before a commitment is made- <em>I want to be sure I'll be happy with it before I commit to buying it</em>. While that makes sense on the surface, it neglects the relationship part of working together. What if, for example, the design work is great but the schedule is totally ignored?</p>
<p><br />Instead of focusing on the final outcome, try focusing on process instead to assess what both the journey and the destination will look like. A firm with experience should be able to show you case studies or examples of their work, ideally in some related area. As you review their work, the quality of their thinking, project management skills, and creative talent should become clear. You'll be able to assess where they're strongest and where they're weakest, and whether or not you'll feel confident working together.</p>
<p><br />If you enter into a working relationship, you'll be able to do so with confidence that you've selected a firm who's skills and capacity are a good fit.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","asking-creative-work-spec","","","",

<p>Last week I received the advance copies of my new (in fact, first!) book ""Brandraising: How Nonprofits Raise Visibility and Money Through Smart Communications"" (Jossey-Bass). I actually finished writing the book in early 2009, so seeing it in print was strange and wonderful.</p>
<p>Brandraising is an approach to branding and communications for nonprofits of all sizes, and I wrote the book specifically for people who work in nonprofits who have limited marketing capacity. I hope the book will serve as a primer for communications professionals who are trying to boost their skills so they can be more effective on behalf of worthy organizations.</p>
<p>So a few people have been asking me how they can learn more about brandraising. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out the book! We'll be organizing a few brandraising parties in 2010- if you'd like to be invited, sign up by sending us an email at <a href=""mailto:smartcommunications@bigducknyc.com"">smartcommunications@bigducknyc.com</a> and we'll keep you posted.</li>
<li>Read the Duck Pond- Big Duck's monthly e-news- you can sign up for it at <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com"" target=""_blank"">www.bigducknyc.com</a>. In it, we highlight upcoming workshops and webinars, many of which have Brandraising-related content.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nope- there's no musical yet- but perhaps we should build the wiki and start working on a score collaboratively? Let me know if you're game.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","brandraising-musical","","","",

Typically, I try to carve out a few days to help review the past year and get set up to improve my work in the upcoming year. </p>","<p>I love this time of year because people seem generally more thoughtful, less harried, and there somehow seems to be more time. Typically, I try to carve out a few days to help review the past year and get set up to improve my work in the upcoming year. Here are a few things I find are invaluable:</p>
<p><br /><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Stopping to assess the past year.</strong> What did I set out to do and how did it go? Reviewing my objectives and the results of my work not only reminds me to celebrate the good work, it helps me remember to be realistic about what's beyond my control.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2. Looking ahead and setting objectives.</strong> Taking a bigger picture view of the year to come, what do I hope to achieve? How will I measure these objectives? What should I anticipate now in order to be successful? I like to write down my personal and professional objectives and then tack them up somewhere I'll be forced to see them regularly. I also share them with others so I'll be forced not to ignore them.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Review the calendar.</strong> Before the year commences, I map out timelines for the big things I plan to work on. When should that new piece go out? Or the new website launch? When do I need to start that new project given the summer vacation I hope to have? You get the point. Looking at the calendar months ahead helps me avoid working reactively because I'm blocking out time to work on my objectives rather than reacting to all the day to surprises live will inevitably deliver.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Clean out my email box.</strong> (You heard me: now do it.) <a href=""http://inboxzero.com/video/"" target=""_blank"">Here's a great video that might help</a>- watch it with colleagues. Nothing makes me feel better than a clean email box. Except, perhaps, a clean diaper. But that's another story.</p>
<p><br /><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Lastly, I rethink my organizing systems.</strong> David Allen's famous <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1262095689&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">""Getting Things Done""</a> system is easy to digest and a quick read. Use it to set up a system that will help you stay organized- with support from software systems like <a href=""http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus"" target=""_blank"">Omnifocus</a> (for Mac only) or Lotus or Outlook if you're a PC. I adapted it to a day-to-day planner I made. Obsessive? Yes. Useful? Definitely.</p>
<p><br />I'd love to hear how you dust off the cobwebs and prepare for a new year- please leave your thoughts in the 'comments' here.</p>

<p>What constitutes a good eating experience, you ask? You'll know. It's when you moan over that next bite. When you want to lick every sauce and crumb from your plate. Again, it doesn't have to be hoity toity--sometimes the best meals are quite...simple. Anyone can put ingredients on a plate and call it a meal. But you can tell when the chef puts an extra flavor punch in your dessert. Or puts two ingredients together that you never thought would work, but somehow, it does. It requires a certain creativity. Isn't that the definition of design?</p>
<p>The end of the year is usually a time of lists--from lists of the best movies of 2009 to the resolutions for 2010. In essence, they're all about reflection and looking forward. In keeping with this spirit, I've attached an excerpt from my list of gastronomic places in NYC (this is definitely not complete). These are places I've religiously visited, places I wish I visited more often, and places I've heard great things about which will be goals for the coming year.So whether you're already here in NYC or looking for an excuse to come visit (besides visiting us here at Big Duck, of course), check these places out--and feel free to add or subtract to the list, and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>A note on size: Using 8.5-inch squares cut from regular letter-sized paper will result in <strong>really big</strong> snowflakes. This is great if that's the look you're going for. But squares cut closer to 4 inches will result in flurries of a more manageable size.</p>

<p>1. Start with a square sheet of paper.</p>

<p>3. Fold the triangle in half again. The open edges should be along the bottom.</p>

<p>4. Starting at the folded edge, make three parallel cuts, stopping a little bit before you reach the opposite edge.</p>

<p>5. Unfold and flatten out the sheet. You should have a series of v-shaped cuts on both sides.</p>

<p><br />One of my favorite ways to get in shape is to strap on my sneakers and do some running. It's not always easy to get myself up and out the door, so I have come up with a method that keeps me motivated. I look ahead some at races ahead and sign myself up for them way in advance.

I've been promising my coworkers that I'd share it for a while now, so here it is.</p>
<p><a href=""http://public.sheet.zoho.com/publish/bigduckliz/budget-worksheet"">http://public.sheet.zoho.com/publish/bigduckliz/budget-worksheet</a></p>
<p>You can make edits directly in the spreadsheet above, or you can <a href=""http://public.sheet.zoho.com/public/bigduckliz/budget-worksheet"" target=""_blank"">open it in a new window</a>. You can also save a copy to your computer as an Excel file (just click the ""Save as Excel"" link in the upper right).</p>
<p>The worksheet follows a pretty simple structure. It compares your anticipated income to your projected expenses, and it breaks expenses down into two types: fixed expenses (the ones you can't change, like rent and health insurance), and flexible expenses (like going out to eat, traveling, etc.). The categorization may differ from person to person--for example, clothing is a flexible expense for me, but it might be a fixed one for you if you have young children who'll grow out of all their clothes in the course of a year.</p>
<p>Speaking of children, a disclaimer: this worksheet mostly reflects my budgeting experience, so it's a little thin on some categories (like children and their attendant expenses).Happy holidays!</p>

<p>My wife hails from Scotland, and if there's one thing the Scots know, it's unhealthy food. Some of that unhealthy food is completely delicious. Tablet (sometimes called ""all-butter tablet""), for example, is one of the finest sweets ever invented, and for the life of me, I can't figure out what (aside from the name) is keeping it from being popular in America. It's sort of fudgy in its final form, with a harder consistency.</p>
<p>This recipe is an Americanized version of the one in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Maw-Broons-Cookbook-Nations-Favourites/dp/1902407458/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260139528&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank""><em>Maw Broon's Cookbook</em></a>, which one of my in-laws told me was the top selling book in Scotland two years ago, other than the final installment of that boy wizard series called <em>Harry Potter</em>. The cookbook is full of delectable Scottish traditions, sure to cause pleasure. And heart disease. <!--break--> I've Americanized the recipe because the Scots do things by weight, and we do things by volume. Also, Maw Broon's recipe is written in a Scottish dialect that, although entertaining, is completely unintelligible. <strong>125 g salted butter (rich-flavored butter encouraged) = one stick</strong> <strong>1 kg sugar = about 5 cups</strong> <strong>1 cup whole milk</strong> <strong>1 14-oz. can of sweetened condensed milk</strong> <strong> </strong>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the sugar and the milk.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9e7e97c1b22ec52a1782f5e8f535e008/files/tablet1.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br />There's a lot of sugar just sitting there in the milk and melted butter.</p>
<p>Stir continuously while the sugar dissolves. This takes quite some time. I'm always surprised at how long it takes, but you really need the mixture to be smooth; otherwise the final product ends up very gritty.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9e7e97c1b22ec52a1782f5e8f535e008/files/tablet2.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br />Getting the sugar to dissolve can take a stupid-long time, well over an hour (last time it took me two).</p>
<p>Add the condensed milk and turn up the heat enough so that the mixture can come to a boil slowly. I should perhaps warn you at this point that the mixture gets as hot as molten lava. You should resist licking your wooden spoon (or stirring implement of choice). This is true for the previous step as well, but it's especially dangerous during this stage when it starts looking delicious. It's a mistake you only make once, but you don't want to make it.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9e7e97c1b22ec52a1782f5e8f535e008/files/tablet3.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br />Adding the sweetened condensed milk starts to get it all caramel-y delicious.</p>
<p>The recipe says that you should let it simmer for 20 minutes. My experience is that it always takes a lot longer than that, possibly 40 minutes or more. You want the mixture to turn a stunning golden brown color. The recipe also says that you can test the mixture for firmness by dropping a tiny bit in cold water to see if it holds its shape. I've found this to be a tricky test as well, because it can fool you into thinking it's done.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9e7e97c1b22ec52a1782f5e8f535e008/files/tablet4.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br />Ooh yeah, that's the color we're looking for.</p>
<p>Once it's golden brown (little flecks of darker brown are normal, by the way) and holds its shape in cold water, remove the saucepan from the heat. Beat strongly with your wooden spoon for five minutes. It should get quite difficult to do. Pour the mixture into a baking tray. Score it with a knife into the size of pieces you want (I recommend keeping them pretty small), and let it cool.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9e7e97c1b22ec52a1782f5e8f535e008/files/tablet5.jpg"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /><br />Grease the pan (with more butter, of course) and let it cool for a little while before scoring.</p>
<p>Then cut it along the scores and enjoy the heck out of it. If you feel like an upgrade, use organic ingredients (yes, I found organic sweetened condensed milk). Less guilt that way! Hae ye a Happy New Year, ye wee jessies! Dinnae be a girl's blouse, and dinnae forget ta sing Rabbie Burns' ""Auld Lange Syne""!</p>

<p><br />After Dylan's 1969 motorcycle accident he ducked into hiding, mostly to spend time with his young children and take a break from touring. Recorded in 1970, ""New Morning"" shows a more endearing and less abstract side of the world famous pop star. There's an unmistakable timber in songs like ""Sign on the Window"" and ""The Man in Me"" that's reminiscent of love and family. The album has a gentle optimism that some of his earlier work lacks. Not to be lumped in with some of the lesser works Dylan produced in the 70's, ""New Morning"" is a testament to fresh beginnings, love and family. A true classic, and a great way to start the new year.</p>

<p><br />""Love is Overtaking Me"" is a compilation of pop songs recorded by composer and multi-instrumentalist Arthur Russell, best known for his cello work and association with New York's underground in the 70's and 80's. This compilation is really an exposé on Russell's life long fascination with popular music, and enthusiasm matched only by his inclination towards the poetics of language. From his earlier folk recordings to his later drum machine laced toe tappers, we get a full view of his personal struggles and lust for life all wrapped up in a musical package.

<p>Sam Cooke's ""Live At The Harlem Square Club"" is widely considered to be one of the greatest soul records of all time. Unlike many other live recordings which run the risk of poor sound quality and lack of technical refinement, this one raises the bar. It manages the tall order of capturing a performance by an artist whose life was about to be cut short, which only makes the depth and swell of the music all the more prismatic. A pioneer and founding father of soul music, Sam Cooke's influence is incalculable. You can almost hear the distress and trouble in the young singers voice. Originally released as a live album entitled One Night Stand, the record was re-issued in 1985. A very soulful way to ring in the new year.</p>

<p>Anne Briggs - Anne Briggs</p>
<p>Anne Briggs is an almost mythic figure in British folk culture. After the death of both parents, a young Briggs was sent to live with her aunt. Shortly after turning 17 she left the comforts of home for a life on the road. It wasn't long before she made a name for herself and by 1963 was a regular on the folk circuit throughout Scotland, Ireland and England. A notoriously wild young woman, Anne often missed more shows that she played, many times to the dismay of her manager and booking agent. In her self titled 1971 album Briggs brings an air to the songs that have the ability to take the listener back in time. These traditional tunes (with two Briggs originals for good measure) have the ability to make any cold winter day seem more like the passing of a spring time afternoon in the meadow.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","spencers-gift-2010-four-records-new-year","","","",

<p>I'd kept all the direct mail we've received for a few months (roughly 45&nbsp;pieces of mail) from organizations of all sizes, shapes, and missions. I culled the group down to about 10 organizations I knew I would feel good about supporting and might have missions my kids could connect with. Over family dinner, I tried to explain what each of the organizations does in broad terms- terms a six year old could relate to. ""These people help sick kids"", for instance, or ""these people build homes for people who don't have homes"".</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/6a67501b0228831aad73a83b3d423898/files/cute.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>Of the 10 organizations, a few of them had missions that were really hard to explain that simply. For instance, while I value and personally support <a href=""http://www.hrc.org//"" target=""_blank"">HRC</a>, explaining advocacy, equal rights or even why lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender folks don't already have equality was a bigger fish than I could fry in just one night. As it was, my kids had trouble keeping track of all the different missions we discussed (so we ended up drawing little pictograms on the backs of each envelope to help).</p>
<p>After a lot of discussion about what they wanted to support, one of my daughters felt strongly she wanted to help less fortunate people, and quickly zoomed in on <a href=""/contentmgr/www.cityharvest.org"" target=""_blank"">City Harvest</a>, <a href=""/contentmgr/www.habitat.org/"" target=""_blank"">Habitat for Humanity</a>, and <a href=""/contentmgr/www.childrensaidsociety.org/%20"" target=""_blank"">Children's Aid Society</a> because she could easily understand how their work helps.&nbsp;My other daughter selected <a href=""/contentmgr/www.parentprojectmd.org/%20"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a>, an organization that does terrific work too, because she wants to help sick kids. (We're making donations to each of these organizations as a result).</p>
<p>As a nonprofit communications consultant, this exercise was much more interesting than I would have expected. It completely reinforced the importance of positioning: being able to boil down what is often complicated work into one simple, big idea that can be easily communicated. In some cases, the work isn't that simple- but in other cases, organizations who'd sent us year-end appeals had entirely failed to articulate their work or its impact altogether.</p>
<p>In 2010, I wonder if there's a valuable lesson in all of this for fundraisers. How can your organization explain itself in the simplest possible terms and make a case for support? If you had to explain what you do to a six year old, could you? And would they be inspired to make a gift?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1,1405%2,1066%3","","","","keeping-it-simple-2010","","","",

I don't really watch late night television, but my sister interned for Conan before he moved to LA, and has been enjoying keeping me up to date as the drama unfolds.</p>
<p>Basically, NBC has decided to cancel Jay Leno at 10 p.m., move him to the 11:35 spot, then push back The Tonight Show back to 12:05 a.m., knocking Jimmy Fallon and the Late Night Show to 1:05. This idea has caused an uproar to say the least.</p>
<p>Conan released a statement on Tuesday (<a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/conan-obrien-says-he-wont-participate-in-the-destruction-of-the-tonight-show.html"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> to read the entire statement) that outlined his feelings about moving to 12:05 a.m. In it he says, ""<em>I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn't the Tonight Show.""</em></p>
<p>He spent the majority of his career working and striving to sit at the desk made famous by Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, and Jay, but he's not just concerned about himself.</p>

<p>Much has been written <a title=""Beth's blog on Chase Contest controversy"" href=""http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/12/charities-cry-foul-on-chase-facebook-charitable-giving-contest.html"" target=""_blank"">criticizing the contest</a> and the initial selection of 100 charities who already received $25,000 and are now vying for the grand prize of $1,000,000. But, despite the controversy in the first round of results, I think there are some positive lessons that can be learned for nonprofits of all sizes.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />1. What's your big idea?</h3>
<p><br />The top 100 charities each have a page where you can vote for them. On that page the nonprofit organization is given a forum to first explain their issue and their mission. In just a few sentences, they have to plead their case to millions of people who may not have ever heard of them before.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. Why should someone support you?</h3>
<p>The next section asks the competing charities to rationalize why they should win the big prize. All nonprofits need to ask for financial support. The ones that do it best build a donor's trust when they can explain how they'd use the funds given to them. I know I'm personally much more likely to give to an organization when I think they not only need my support, but will use it well.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3. What is your ultimate vision for success?</h3>
<p><strong></strong><br />The last part of each organization's write-up is about the outcome their organization hopes to achieve--the change they want to see in the world. If an organization or donor were about to give you $1 million could you tell them what you'd do with it? If a program participant was questioning whether they should sign up with your org or another, how would you convince them to join you? The more you might hesitate to have an answer, the less you might be to get their support or involvement.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />4. What is your story and how do you tell it?</h3>
<p><br />Organizations in the contest are also able to post videos and pictures of their work--and their community--in action. The power of storytelling can help nonprofits not only communicate their mission generally, but it can help raise awareness, engage activists, and generate support. Do you have a short and sweet video or set of pictures that could motivate someone to connect with you?<br />Here's the video that one of our client's <a title=""Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy's entry page on the Chase Contest"" href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=nws_index"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a> produced for the contest. The messaging is strong and the visuals are compelling--all boys and families from their community (no stock photos here!) They use the video to reinforce their mission and the need for support: to end Duchenne, a rare but devastating genetic disorder that robs the lives of at least two boys and young men each day.</p>

<p><br />The February 2010 issue of <a href=""http://printmag.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>Print Magazine</em></a> features an article called ""The Incredible Shrinking Annual Report"" by Liza Featherstone. (I'd link to it here, but the good people at <em>Print</em> don't offer their content online. Maybe that's why the magazine is still called <em>Print</em>??)</p>
<p><br />In the piece, Ms. Featherstone talks about how the business of producing corporate annual reports has essentially withered and died- leaving a wake of writers, designers and printers looking for work. Before 2007, explains Ms. Featherstone, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required shareholders to be mailed an annual report- but after 2007, the could be posted online. Trees were saved (yay!), jobs were lost (boo!).</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />For <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck's</a> first decade or so (I founded the Duck in 1994), we produced a lot of nonprofit annual reports too. The bigger the nonprofit, the more the donors wanted to see their name(s) listed, and the longer the list. But in the past few years, perhaps because those same donors no longer live in a world where they expect to see shiny printed reports, the number of traditional reports we produce is on the decline. Sure, a handful of the biggest organizations we work with still produce them, but less often.</p>
<p><br />In their wake, are some really interesting new solutions have emerged. Here are three of my favorite new alternatives to the traditional annual report.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>A good looking brochure with a pocket folder you can insert financials, donors, and other dated/report-like information into</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Videos from staff and clients</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Interactive online reports that use Flash, video , and other animated features</li>

This year, their <a href=""http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/92104.cfm"" target=""_blank"">report</a> features a two minute video (a personal story), and downloadable PDFs. In other years, they've integrated Flash, sexy photography, and other devices that leverage the dynamic bells and whistles of the web.</p>

<p><br /><a href=""http://www.give.org"" target=""_blank"">The Wise Giving Alliance</a> is the Better Business Bureau's charity watchdog, and they publish a <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/us/Charity-Standards/"" target=""_blank"">set of standards</a> any nonprofit who wants their seal of approval must meet. With regard to annual reports, the Wise Giving Alliance's Charity Standards state:</p>
<p><br />""<strong>16. Have an annual report available to all, on request, that includes: </strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>the organization's mission statement,</strong></li>
<li><strong>a summary of the past year's program service accomplishments,</strong></li>
<li><strong>a roster of the officers and members of the board of directors,</strong></li>
<li><strong>financial information that includes (i) total income in the past fiscal year, (ii) expenses in the same program, fund raising and administrative categories as in the financial statements, and (iii) ending net assets.""</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><br /><br />Interesting to note that a) they feel you still need to produce an annual report, but b) they don't tell you how to publish it. In fact, their <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/us/2007-bbb-wise-giving-alliance-annual-report/"" target=""_blank"">own annual report </a> is posted online as text-only- and is decidedly low-tech.</p>
<p><br />What I love about this shift in how annual reports are published is that it emphasizes what's right: sharing your organization's mission, work, financials and leadership - not the medium. The doors are now wide open to publish the information donors and watchdogs want about your organization via the channel that best reflects your organization's personality and positioning. So go for it: Tweet your financials! Facebook your accomplishments! Just do it in a way that's authentic to your organization and transparent, please.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","annual-report-dead-long-live-annual-report","","","",

<p><br /><strong>Capacity -&nbsp;</strong>Who doesn't say ""capacity building""? Heck, at Big Duck, one of our areas of work is around capacity building. The real trouble with <em>capacity</em> is that people use it to mean many things, including <em>capability</em> or <em>ability</em>, both of which are clearer, less pretentious words. Watch how you use this one.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Impact -&nbsp;</strong>Politicians and marketing/communications professionals (you're welcome!) may have fooled you into thinking that <em>impact</em> is a verb that means, ""to have an effect."" For example, ""Our work impacts the lives of teens."" To the chagrin of language purists (of which there is more than one here at Big Duck), <em>impact</em> will likely join the growing list of nouns that have been verbed into existence (such as <em>contact</em>, <em>date</em>, <em>curb</em>, or <em>elbow</em>). Until the standard style guides and dictionaries tell you it's okay, we recommend that you avoid using <em>impact</em> as a verb and angering the language purists in your circle. They live among you. I'll get some headshakes for using <em>verb</em> as a verb too. And by the way, <em>impactful</em> isn't a real word.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Web site -&nbsp;</strong>Everyone has a website, and you should feel free to talk about yours. But when you write about your website, write about your <em>website</em>, not your <em>Web site</em>. Nothing will make you seem like a fuddy-duddy faster than capitalizing <em>Web site</em> and making it two words. It's like you're harkening back to the simpler days of the World Wide Web and its Information Superhighway. Strive toward having some tech cred. If you have a style guide that still says <em>Web site</em>, it's probably time to update it.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Catalyst -&nbsp;</strong>A lot of nonprofits like to think of themselves as catalysts, never changing but affecting change in their arena. It's a nice metaphor. I struggled with high school chemistry, and I had this really tough and serious teacher from Iran. I managed to really screw up on a couple of the tests early in the semester, from which my overall grade would never be able to recover. I had my sights set on some competitive colleges, so this was very worrisome for me. But I worked hard and showed improvement, eventually getting an A- on the final. On the final day, the teacher asked if I wanted to hear my grade. Knowing I'd mathematically earned a C, I despondently told him to go ahead. ""Daniel..."" he said (no one called me Daniel), ""You work hard and show improvement. I think I give you A."" It was amazing. The only problem is that when I hear <em>catalyst</em>, my mind goes back to high school chemistry, not your organization. Am I alone on this?</p>
<p><br />There are more examples, I'm sure, and you probably have some of your own. Please feel free to add your suggestions in the comments section.</p>
<p><br />Are we saying that you shouldn't use any of these words? I'm a bit of a free speech purist, so I wouldn't absolutely forbid you from saying or writing certain terms. By all means, use these words if you really want to. Just know that if you do we're sitting here in our offices totally judging you. Totally.</p>
<p><br />But don't worry: we're judging ourselves too. Some of these terms get a lot of airplay at Big Duck. But hey, that just gives us something to strive toward throughout 2010.</p>
<p><br />We're not the only ones taking a look at ""bad words"" in 2010. Our friends over at Douglas Gould have recently kicked off their <a href=""http://badwordsblog.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Words blog</a>. Among other interesting posts, there's a nice little screed about ""Gun Show Loophole"" that's definitely worth reading.

<p><br />But did you feel you were watching a slideshow? Definitely not. Same thing with Al Gore's film, <a href=""http://www.climatecrisis.net/"" target=""_blank"">""Inconvenient Truth""</a>, which is basically two hours Al Gore talking through a really fancy Keynote presentation about climate change.</p>
<p><br />Steve Jobs and Al Gore both understand the following key elements of making a compelling presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody wants to read bullets or too much copy on a slide.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Images (particularly ones that are dramatic or funny) can underscore a point well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Slides should support and complement what you're saying- not repeat it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You've got to know your content: practice, practice, practice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use language your audience can relate to- not your own insider jargon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Those generic slide templates don't add anything: creating original slides where large images and type dominate is much more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />When you're presenting information about a difficult issue or making a compelling case to a donor, using images and brief phrases rather than bullets puts more pressure on you to outline and/or script your comments and get creative. Here are a four tools to help you do that.</p>
<p><br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Flickr</a>- is a photo sharing site where individuals post their images. When people post their photos or illustrations, they can select how they are willing to share their image using a copyright resource called <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/"" target=""_blank"">Creative Commons</a>. Many individuals allow you to use their photos non-commercially (for instance, in your presentation) if you give them credit. Just scroll down to the bottom right corner in Flickr and you'll see if you have the creator's permission to use the image you've found. (If you do use someone's image, it's polite to email them and let them know.)</p>
<p><br /><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/"" target=""_blank"">Slideshare</a>- This website allows individuals to post presentations they've made and share them publicly or privately. Watching other people's presentations, particularly if they're on a topic you enjoy, can help you spark ideas. If you're not sure where to start, check out the top presentations of the day on the homepage, or search for slideshows by nonprofit social media guru <a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/"" target=""_blank"">Beth Kanter.</a></p>
<p><br />Ask questions. Asking questions helps get your audience involved and can break through the wall between presenter and audience. Walk around the room or chat informally with people before you get started to ask their opinions about the topic you'll be discussing, or ask a 'show of hands' every so often while you're speaking. Throughout your presentation, try to come back to the issues that were raised and weave them in to your comments so participants feel you've heard and addressed them directly.<br />There are also several books about presenting, if you want to make a study of it.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","presenting-what-we-can-all-learn-steve-jobs","","","",

<!--break-->
<p><br />For the 2009 year-end season, we kept an eye out for interesting campaigns that found their ways into our inbox. Although Twitter and Facebook are certainly all the rage, email is still king when it comes to online fundraising. Here are a few dos and don'ts that we saw. Keep them in mind as you develop your 2010 online fundraising strategies.</p>
<h2 class=""alt""><br />What we hope to see more of in 2010 (aka ""The Dos"")</h2>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Strategies that work.</h3>
<p>Many of you seem to love a good matching gift campaign--and your donors do too. While this may seem like a pretty canned approach to fundraising, it still works--and works quite well for many groups out there.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Copy and design that compel readers to give.</h3>
<p>If you've stated a fundraising goal, let your supporters know how it is going with periodic updates. When possible use real numbers--even if they look odd or messy. Real numbers are much more believable, and it's always good to be transparent.</p>
<p><br />And then there's always the classic thermometer. We've seen some organizations do nice riffs on this with designs that match the campaigns' themes. Using visuals can make your ask more compelling. One organization even placed their thermometer horizontally across the top of the message so it appeared in the preview pane.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Subject lines that make us want to read more because they are timely, curious, or engaging.</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to judge a subject line is to take a look at how that message performed (i.e. how did the open and click-through rates compare to previous messages). What works for some may not be right for you. But here were a few of our favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>48 hours left-help us reach $1 million for animals <em>(strong sense of urgency and connection to a goal)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before The Ball Drops Tonight <em>(sent hours before midnight on 12/31)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A Holiday Card Like You've Never Seen <em>(the hook is baited--and we bit!)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom and Justice--the Sum of Our Efforts <em>(connects the organization's work with the donor's passion)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Connecting the dots and telling a good story.</h3>
<p>All good stories and appeals for support have a beginning, middle, and end. They state a goal up front, explain how the donations will be used, send updates along the way, include relevant blurbs (in enewsletters, home and donation pages, Facebook pages and Causes updates, and occasional tweets). They even tell us how the campaign fares overall with a report after January 1 and say, ""thank you."" You are most welcome.</p>
<h2 class=""alt""><br />What we wish you'd avoid in 2010 (aka ""The Don'ts"")</h2>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Strategies that fail to engage and cultivate existing and potential donors.</h3>
<p>You know we love a good matching gift campaign, but not when it's likely to discourage high gifts. One nonprofit offered to match only gifts less than $250. I guess we'll take our $500 and give it elsewhere.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Messages that lack quality control or haven't been tested internally</h3>
<p>We also saw a few groups who forgot about the almighty power of peer review and testing. Victims of this fate forgot to</p>
<ul>

<h3 class=""alt"">It was the best of times.</h3>
<p class=""alt"">Four words can sum up why the first fundraiser was awesome: Peruvian chicken house party.</p>
<p>Even though we live in the most diverse borough (sorry, Brooklynites: that's Queens) in the most diverse city in the world (sorry, Boise: that's New York City), my wife and I have a relatively homogeneous life. So when we had the chance to attend a party thrown by Peruvians, we were all for it. The host was trying to raise money to bring her daughter here from Peru. So she made a traditional Peruvian chicken dinner, which she sold for $10 a plate.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />The food was outstanding. The woman had bought 100 whole chickens from some place in Queens (her apartment is in Westchester county), quartered them, and marinated them in a giant tub in her fridge. Then, as people arrived, she deep-fried the chicken, and served it with delicious potatoes and salad.</p>
<p><br />But the whole event was more than just the sum of its food. The music was blasting. The apartment was small, but she'd put chairs around the perimeter and left some room for dancing. Which people did. A young Peruvian dude hit on my wife. And the hosts and other Peruvian guests really did everything they could to make us confused gringos feel welcome in what can only be described as quite a foreign environment for us. It was a party.<br />As an attendee, I can only describe the fundraiser as an enormous success. It was certainly memorable.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />It was the worst of times.</h3>
<p>The second fundraiser was a charity concert, and it included a presentation from a titan in this particular field. He is not only renowned for his work, but he's also highly touted as an inspirational speaker, even at his advanced age. He's never lost touch with his passion for the work he revolutionized.</p>
<p><br />People love music and people love this man, so what went so wrong?</p>
<p><br />I had my first serious concerns as soon as we walked in the door. A half dozen or so panicked volunteers were working the sign-in/sign-up table, and yet it took us about ten minutes to get through the line. The whole operation was eventually taken over by an attendee-turned-volunteer who couldn't believe how inefficient the whole thing was. That improved things slightly. Just slightly.</p>
<p><br />The venue itself was a disaster. It was a large, gorgeous church, and I can see why it seemed like a good idea. It was apparently free. And music in churches can be lovely. But the acoustics were no good for the presentation. The titan did all he could under the circumstances, but I could only hear about 50% of what he said. His work is life-changing for his clients and deeply moving, and it was heartbreaking to think that people unfamiliar with his work still wouldn't understand its power. And I can't say I was surprised to see people dozing off.</p>
<p><br />This titan's work is focused primarily on children, so it's certainly no surprise that there were lots of children there. In fact, it was probably appropriate. But in the echo chamber that was the venue, every time a child or children screamed, you couldn't hear anything else.</p>
<p><br />The concert itself was desperately long. My wife and I actually ended up slinking out. The thought of sitting in those hard pews for three-plus hours was too much to take. They just shouldn't have asked so much from an audience.</p>
<p><br />Perhaps the most disconcerting part was the attendance. It obviously hadn't been promoted well. My wife works in this particular field, and she caught wind about the event from one of her colleagues. I've gotten to know a bunch of my wife's professional friends over the years, and yet very few of them were there. They are part of quite a large community that had to be unaware that the event was happening. Otherwise I'm sure they'd have been there. Their admiration for this particular titan and his work knows no bounds.</p>
<p><br />My guess is that the event planners spent so much time organizing the event itself that they forgot to reach out to the many potential attendees. The crowd was a tiny subsection of the community, and no one ever thought to ask, ""So, who <em>else</em> can we invite?"" With a simple listserv posting, they could have easily doubled (if not tripled) the attendance.</p>
<p><br />The organization benefiting from this event is sinking, and it's going to take a miracle to keep it afloat. It makes me sad to say that this event was not the miracle they needed.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />If I'd Ever Actually Read <em>Tale of Two Cities</em> I'd Have a Clever Dickensian Conclusion Heading Here.</h3>
<p><br />Events are a challenge, no doubt. But if you do them right, they can pay off. One was good for me; one was bad for me. But how did they work out for the organizations?</p>
<p><br />The concert event raised just over $2,100 after expenses. Considering the logistics of the concert, the many stressed-out volunteers running around during the event to help it run smoothly, and the obvious time put in by the number of parties involved to make it possible, it felt like it could have--and should have--raised a lot more. And the funds raised--which must go to provide direct service to the clients (i.e. can't be used for general operating support, where the organization needs the most help)--won't go far in saving the sinking organization.</p>
<p><br />Technically, the concert event did better than the chicken party, which netted our host $900 after expenses. Her upfront cost consisted primarily of the 100 chickens.</p>
<p><br />But the chicken party succeeded in other important ways. It was festive. The host, the Queen of the Peruvian chicken house party, was having a great time along with her guests. Yes, she was busy cooking and serving food, and she and a friend pretty much took care of everything, but they also seemed happy to be doing so (in marked contrast to the volunteers at the concert event, who seemed stressed out of their minds). She kept it simple and manageable.</p>
<p><br />Finally, it comes down to attendance. The concert event had noticeable absences, especially in a venue that was a bit big. The chicken party was well attended. It had been going on for much of the day already when we got there, and people were steadily streaming in and out. The hostess told everyone she knew about it, and then they told everyone they knew. Some of the people we met had also not met the hostess before that evening. Word got around. And it got around well ahead of time. It had been on our calendars for at least two months. We could plan ahead for it.</p>
<p><br />The best news of all, of course, is that the chicken party accomplished the stated goal. The $900 the host raised is almost exactly what she needs for airfare and various immigration fees. She'll be reunited with her daughter in February. That, my friends, is a successful fundraiser.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1","","","","tale-two-fundraisers","","","",

It's got some great ideas and predictions from a range of folks -- including a few names you might recognize. Here's a few excerpts from these pros. Notice how many of them swirl around the theme of being smart and consistent with how you communicate with and engage donors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some organizations will continue to prosper while many will struggle to meet last year's results. The groups most likely to prosper are those that provide basic services like food and shelter; have kept their cause top-of-mind with donors and the public with smart, consistent marketing efforts; and have maintained or expanded their acquisition and lapsed reactivation programs. ... In 2010, nonprofit fundraisers should build on their wins from 2009 and find new ways to tell their donors how important they are. -- <strong>Lynn Edmonds, president, <a href=""http://www.lwra.com/"" target=""_blank"">L.W. Robbins Associates</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The balance between acquisition focus versus retention focus is a major challenge or opportunity for nonprofits. If your organization was too acquisition-focused, then you likely were hit harder by the economy. If your organization was retention-focused, then you were probably less impacted. Our research and customer feedback has indicated that organizations leveraging their CRM tools are seeing donor retention holding steady, but with lower gift amounts than in previous years. -- <strong>Steve MacLaughlin, director of Internet solutions, <a href=""http://www.blackbaud.com/"" target=""_blank"">Blackbaud</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Savvy special-event planners are finding they have to work much harder to find sponsors and must plan to replace those that either reduce their level of giving or don't give at all. However, as a possible indicator of an improved economy, those individuals who attend events seem to be spending more freely. -- <strong>Alexander ""Sandy"" Macnab, president, <a href=""http://www.alexandermacnab.com/"" target=""_blank"">Alexander Macnab &amp; Co.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fundraisers that have been successful have increased communication with their donors and continued to tell their positive and inspirational stories. The opportunity today is to lift donors up with the news of the wonderful things that nonprofits do to change lives, as everyone surely needs a bit of good news these days. ... Finally, one must communicate by phone, mail and Web to your donors as never before -- passionately, positively and personally -- so that you inspire them in these very challenging times to allow you to continue doing your mission. -- <strong>John Braune, president and CEO, <a href=""http://www.theheritagecompany.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Heritage Co.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even in good times, an organization's e-mail list experiences a natural ""churn rate"" of about 30 percent, meaning that about a third of the list turns inactive (with or without the users unsubscribing) every year. So just to offset this natural churn, you need to attract an additional 30 percent to your e-mail list every year -- and more if you want to grow the list. -- <strong>Clinton O'Brien, vice president of business development, <a href=""http://www.care2.com/"" target=""_blank"">Care2</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nonprofits will not see a rapid recovery in giving to previous levels and will continue to need to work harder to acquire new donors and retain those they have. My first piece of advice is to focus on excelling at the basics. A lot of organizations are attracted to the cool, new thing, e.g., social media, before they've done the basics correctly, like optimizing their Web site for conversion, sending e-mails that people want and crafting compelling, multistep appeals. -- <strong>Vinay Bhagat, founder and chief strategy officer, <a href=""http://www.convio.com"" target=""_blank"">Convio</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Charities need to brace themselves for the next 18 months, as things won't be getting any better despite media coverage saying the recession is coming to an end! 2010 will be a year of stewardship and focusing on your existing donors. -- <strong>Tony Elischer, managing director, <a href=""http://www.thinkcs.org/"" target=""_blank"">Think Consulting Solutions</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2009, the fundraisers I spoke with seemed to struggle with variations of the same issues. First, how to distinguish their organizations in an increasingly competitive giving climate. The ones that managed their communications proactively and with agility seemed to fare better than the ones that maintained business as usual, from what I've seen -- and this is what prompted me to write ""<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising</a>,"" a book about the importance of effective communications on fundraising. As we move into 2010, nonprofits seem to be optimistic that there's a turnaround happening that will positively impact donations. -- <strong>Sarah Durham, founder and principal, <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As we get into 2010, I think integration is still the name of the game. All the new channels and tools that nonprofits have for communicating their great work -- and asking for money -- are exciting. But, it is important that nonprofits remember not to abandon old tricks in favor of new ones. Raising money via Twitter or texting might work for some, but sending out a series of messages via e-mail/direct mail with a consistent and compelling theme still brings in the bucks. Connect those messages to your Web site, your donation landing pages, your Facebook status updates, etc. The point is: Don't think in a vacuum. Donors are looking to hear about you in many places -- some may just want to communicate in one channel; others will connect with you in several. The messaging and visual story of all these channels should reflect one another, while also taking into account the unique aspects of that channel and how people use it. -- <strong>Farra Trompeter, vice president, client relations and strategy, <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another great challenge I see for nonprofits is the temptation to cut their fundraising efforts or staff. While a downturn can be a convenient time, a handy excuse, to make cuts that are long overdue, marketing and fundraising efforts still need to be robust. The return will come. The ROI will be there, although it might not be in the fiscal year. -- <strong>Marc A. Pitman, founder and principal, <a href=""http://fundraisingcoach.com/"" target=""_blank"">fundraisingcoach.com</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The charities that are growing in today's environment are those that are positioned well and clearly defined in their category. They have continued to strengthen their relevancy with donors by providing timely information about themselves in relation to current events. These organizations are harnessing the power of donor behavior to acquire and inspire them to do more and be more through a brand experience. They consistently communicate a vision of the donor standing side by side with the organization, which positions the donor as part of the solution, and by doing so, the donor finds meaning and purpose -- for few things in life are more important, or more powerful, than leading people to such remarkable moments of self-discovery. -- <strong>Todd Baker, vice president and senior strategist, <a href=""http://www.grizzard.com"" target=""_blank"">Grizzard</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mobile technology is the next frontier in nonprofit communications. Those that have built communities on social-networking sites over the last few years will reap the most benefits initially because social media is leading the way on the mobile Web. ... This year will be the fundraising season where we will start to see whether building communities on social-networking sites produces results in terms of dollars raised. I know my [2009] end-of-year donations are allotted for those nonprofits that engaged me best on Twitter and Facebook throughout 2009. -- <strong>Heather Mansfield, owner, <a href=""http://www.diosacommunications.com/"" target=""_blank"">DIOSA|Communications</a></strong></li>

<p><br />As I started watching the opening ceremony and the subsequent individual competitions, it struck me how the Olympics brand is such a <em>global</em> venture. And I don't just mean global in the ""countries-around-the-world"" sense. I mean from a designer's standpoint, it's a dream opportunity to design things on a scale that can vary from the size of a pen to something akin to a literal architectural village, across multiple disciplines.</p>

<p><br />There are a lot of competing and overwhelming forces that come to play when you take a look at an event such as this. There are the participating nations. There are the sponsors. The host city/country. And the Olympic brand itself. I admit to having a ""whoa"" moment myself even as I try to think about all of these things, and how they work together. What has helped me understand all of this visual eye candy is something I use myself when I look at the work we do for our clients--<em>what's the hierarchy</em>?</p>
<p><br />A visual hierarchy in design uses colors, sizes, textures--all sorts of tools to advise a viewer on what to ""read"" first. It suggests a sense of order and importance, giving some ground rules for the audience to follow. It's the difference between looking at a page full of clutter, and a page that feels more manageable to read. For example, a big headline on the front page of a newspaper tells the reader that he/she should pay attention there first, while subsequent smaller articles get behind the line.</p>
<p><br />The Olympic symbol, with its five colorful interlocking rings, has always been a very well known and universal one. They're not just something physical--they're a set of ideals meant to span the globe. In fact, they refer to themselves as a ""movement."" The Olympic symbol is the ""mother brand"" during the games, at the top of the hierarchy. However, it's also one of those rare brands whose goals are to act as a vessel to help spotlight something else. One of the decisions to have those Olympic colors on the flag was that someone figured that every country had at least one of those colors on their flags. A little something for everyone, right?</p>
<p><br />With this idea, the Olympic brand invites a lot of interpretations on how to work <em>with</em> that symbol, while incorporating each host city's unique perspective. This is the part that I find most fascinating--how many different ways can one use ideas like ""winter"" or ""summer"" and ""sports"" mixed in with your city's personal characteristics, while respecting those Olympic ideals?</p>
<p><br />Lots.</p>
<p><br />For the 2010 Winter Games going on now, the design team began with the Vancouver Olympics <a href=""http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/about-vanoc/the-vancouver-2010-brand/vancouver-2010-olympic-games-emblem/ilanaaq-%E2%80%93-vancouver-2010-olympic-winter-games-emblem_89220ym.html"" target=""_blank"">emblem</a>, which harkened to the inukshuk, a directional rock form created by the Inuit people of Canada.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/6d8232c3b82b11f341d7b64b2c8ba45b/files/vancouver.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /><br /><br />From there, design elements were created--a literal and figurative visual landscape to tie all of the individual games together. It's an attention-grabber, a way to incorporate a story that can have an impact in a way the emblem alone could not.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/6d8232c3b82b11f341d7b64b2c8ba45b/files/vancouver2010_2_300x225.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br /><br />There's a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MsATxMHnO8"" target=""_blank"">nice video here</a> that gives you a glimpse of the story behind some of the thinking of this look.</p>
<p><br />So what was my takeaway from all these Olympic designs? Love 'em or hate 'em, I'm impressed with the countless ways designers have worked within the Olympic guidelines. And grown and adapted to new technologies, techniques, and aesthetics.</p>
<p><br />Here are some other thoughts, o great nonprofiteers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have your brand, guard it, enforce it, and nurture it.</li>
<li>Have a styleguide with rules for both the visual identity and messaging. This will help ensure consistency in how you project yourself to your audience. From the visual side, it gives your agency or designer a set of parameters from which to work.</li>
<li>Look at your designs from a hierarchical and contextual point of view. Who’s the hero? Are logos fighting each other for attention? How can my brand work in unusual environments?</li>
<li>The rules evolve everyday. So should your brand. Do a regular checkup and update your styleguide to allow for flexibility to stay relevant and forward-looking.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, what’s next? I leave you with the look of the next Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. You may notice that for the first time, the emblem has a url, meant to address a more digital audience.</p>
<p>I wonder what other new ways a brand will find to take the spotlight in 2014.</p>

<li>Bet you thought I couldn't find a tie between the Olympics and nonprofit communications. Well, stand back: on MediaShift, Craig Silverman talks social media with Graeme Menzies, director of online communications for the Vancouver games, who raises some very interesting points about <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/02/inside-the-social-media-strategy-of-the-winter-olympic-games043.html"" target=""_blank"">how critical it is to have a flexible approach online tools</a>. Just think: four years ago, as the Vancouver team was putting together its plans and learning lessons from Turino, Facebook was still just for college students, and Twitter was hardly a twinkle in Jack Dorsey's eye. The takeaway: make sure your approach to social media includes clear goals and a coherent strategy; tactical plans based on specific tools will have a pretty short shelf-life.</li>

<p><br />""That's all well and good,"" I hear you say, ""but what's it got to do with nonprofit communication?"" Three things, that's what:</p>
<!--break-->
<h3 class=""alt""><br />1. Consistent messaging across multiple campaigns</h3>
<p>Since he started out, Jamie's message has been the same: good food should be accessible to everyone. All of his cookbooks and his recent social benefit campaigns have that message at their heart, even though they're addressed to very different audiences. Because of this consistency, Jamie's been able to make a 'good food' name for himself and draw public and government attention to the issues that he cares about. Consistent messaging across all the things you do is essential if you want to be heard and understood.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. Personality</h3>
<p>OK, it's not only consistent messaging that's got Jamie Oliver where he is today. He also has plenty of personality (maybe even too much for some people?). His 'cheeky cockney' shtick doesn't appeal to everyone, but that doesn't matter - it appeals to the people he needs it to appeal to, whether they're a TV audience looking for entertainment or school children looking for... well, entertainment. Jamie Oliver's personality sets him apart from all the other celebrity chefs out there and draws people to his cause more than just the facts about the dangers of junk food could. Does your organization know what its personality is, and how it can use that to engage more supporters? If not, that might be something worth thinking about.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong></strong>3. Keeping communications going</h3>
<p><br />On the one hand, Jamie's multiple campaigns are great, because he's reaching more and more people. On the other though, when a new campaign starts, communication about his previous campaigns seems to slow down or stop. Sure, he still has all of his campaigns <a href=""http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/"" target=""_blank"">listed</a> on his <a href=""http://www.jamieoliver.com/"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, with background information, facts and figures and actions to be taken, but there's not much information on the progress each campaign is making or on how urgent further action might be. Having watched the original <em>Jamie's School Dinners</em> series in 2005, I'm genuinely interested in the impact that the campaign has had, its success stories, and how much work there still is to be done. That information doesn't seem to be available though, which is frustrating. Just because you've started a new program or campaign doesn't mean you can stop communicating about the old ones - there are still people out there who are interested in them, and who might well be disappointed if you seem to have forgotten about your old programs in favor of your newest and shiniest endeavor.</p>
<p><br />So there you have it: three lessons in nonprofit communication from a celebrity chef. Who'd have thought it? And if that's not enough for you, check out Jamie's <a href=""http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/risotto/basic-risotto-recipe"" target=""_blank"">basic risotto recipe</a>; it's unfailingly yummy.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1405%1,1066%2,1409%3,1408%4,1407%5","","","","jamie-oliver-better-or-worse","","","",

I've summarized a few highlights from the conversation below.</p>
<!--break-->
<h3 class=""alt""><br />When in doubt, Facebook.</h3>
<p><br />Asked to identify their go-to social media tool, three of the five panelists quickly chose Facebook. It makes sense. Over 100 million Americans are active Facebook users--as <a href=""http://twitter.com/ruthgallogly"" target=""_blank"">Ruth Gallogly</a> said, ""It's where the people are."" Twitter, though it obviously has some powerful potential, is <a href=""http://trends.google.com/websites?q=twitter.com,+facebook.com"" target=""_blank"">still a baby by comparison</a>.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Celebrity power is overrated.</h3>
<p><br />Online and off, panelists agreed, the search for celebrity endorsements is generally not worth the effort. That said, a few tips for your nonprofit to keep in mind.</p>
<p><br />First, target celebrities with a close connection to your mission. <a href=""http://www.thegreatschlep.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Great Schlep</a>, a campaign co-founded by panelist <a href=""http://twitter.com/ariW"" target=""_blank"">Ari Wallach</a> to get out the Jewish vote in Florida, sought out Sarah Silverman's participation because they knew it would be a great fit for her: Jewish, Obama supporter, comedienne. Similarly, the ""I Fed"" campaign found that reaching out to food celebrities, whose work was already an obvious connection to the campaign's mission, produced great response.</p>
<p><br />Second, social media can offer a nice way to lower the bar for celebrity participation on both sides. Tweeting about your event or participating in a live chat is a lot easier for a celebrity supporter than showing up at an event. And because the stakes are lower, you can afford spend less time on the ask, and keep your request casual (e.g. a direct message on Twitter, or an email).</p>
<p><br />Third, focus on value, not just on big names. A well-chosen endorsement from a lesser-known celebrity whose issue aligns with yours and who cultivates a small but dedicated group of followers might generate a lot more activity than a casual tweet from a big name. As <a href=""http://twitter.com/jasonwhat"" target=""_blank"">Jason Wojciechowski</a> said, we're an engagement culture now--it's not just about the number of eyeballs, it's about the degree of the response.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />Email rules.</h3>
<p><br />Panelists identified email as ""the most important thing any nonprofit can do"". And it's true--in the context of online campaigns, email is still likely to be your most important tool. At the same time, America's inboxes are becoming ever more crowded, so if your nonprofit emails hope to stand out from the pack, they have their work cut out for them.</p>
<p><br />The good news, <a href=""http://twitter.com/JeremyGoldberg"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Goldberg</a> reminds, is that it's not that people don't want email--it's that they don't want <em>bad</em> email. So make your emails relevant and purposeful. Request specific actions, mix in a few cultivation message that validate your supporter's participation, and make the case for why it's worth their while to spend their precious time and attention on your message.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Don't skip the strategy.</h3>
<p><br />When a nonprofit doesn't achieve what they hope to online, the panelists agreed, it's rarely a failure of technology--it's nearly always a failure of strategy. Facebook and Twitter can bring about some exciting results, but it's important to see them a means to a larger end. Some thoughts from the panelists on how to craft a great strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it results-driven, sustainable, and holistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Start with goals, and choose the tools that help you achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be discerning--don't try to be everywhere at once. It's exhausting, and ineffective to boot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://twitter.com/sorayad"" target=""_blank"">Soraya Darabi</a> recommends thinking carefully about who your audiences are, and choosing the best ways to reach them. If you're a local organization, target local bloggers and tweeters; if you're trying to reach East Coast college students, Facebook ads might be a good way to go.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />But...</h3>
<p><br />What's a good discussion of social media without a caveat or two?</p>
<p><br />One panelist suggested that for the cost of a direct mail program, a nonprofit could do a lot more online. True; online tools avoid costs like postage and printing. But over time, do your online efforts bring in the same results?</p>
<p><br />Social media are exciting, immediate, ever-changing. But they encourage a short-term view: build our Facebook fan base so we can win the corporate giving contest. Set up a Twitter feed so we can get Oprah to tweet about our campaign. What's often missing is a critical element of any social media strategy: return on investment.</p>
<p><br />The ""I Fed"" campaign is a great example of short-form success. Robin Hood and its partners invested a small amount of capital, worked hard to leverage the opportunities available through social media, and saw impressive returns. But before your nonprofit rushes out to try and duplicate their success, be sure to think through to the long view. Once you've brought in those eager new donors, what's your plan for keeping them on board? Over time, how successful are you at retaining them and turning them into regular, committed supporters?</p>
<p><br />Asking for votes or retweets may turn out to be a win-win--easy for supporters, and rewarding for you. But if you're like most nonprofits, you aren't looking to offer a disposable do-good experience; you're hoping to make a life-long connection with supporters. So as you move forward in social media, keep asking yourselves whether your strategy is really getting the results you want, and helping you build a solid base of supporters who are responsive in the short-term and committed in the long-term.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1405%1,1413%2","","","","make-your-next-campaign-social-media-success","","","",

Facebook games take two of the top three spots--<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TexasHoldEm"" target=""_blank"">Texas Hold'em Poker</a> with more than 13 million fans and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MafiaWarsFans"" target=""_blank"">Mafia Wars</a> with just shy of 10 million--and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/facebook?ref=search&amp;sid=5737714.1802815712..1"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> itself is in sixth place with about 7.6 million fans. As someone with very little patience for Facebook games junking up my news feed, I'm at least gratified to see that <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Not-Playing-Farmville/123990737273"" target=""_blank"">Not Playing Farmville</a> has a healthy 2 million fans.</p>
<p><br />Among pages representing actual human beings, the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/michaeljackson"" target=""_blank"">King of Pop</a> is clearly also the king of Facebook with over 11 million fans. President and social media powerhouse <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/barackobama"" target=""_blank"">Barack Obama</a> takes second place with 7.8 million fans. But the third most popular person on Facebook is--<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel"" target=""_blank"">Vin Diesel</a>? Apparently, the star of screen gems like <em>The Pacifier</em> has only about 125,000 fewer fans than the Commander-in-chief. Kind of makes you wonder. The most popular woman on Facebook is Hollywood mega-hottie <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MeganFox"" target=""_blank"">Megan Fox</a>. She may not have <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MerylStreep"" target=""_blank"">Meryl Streep</a>'s acting chops, but her 6 million fans outnumber the 16-time Oscar nominee's 300,000 by about 20:1. On an unrelated note, I am beginning a screenplay for <em>XXX vs. Transformers</em>. I have a feeling it might be the most popular movie ever.</p>
<p><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Starbucks"" target=""_blank"">Starbucks</a> tops the chart in terms of consumer brands with about 6 million fans. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cocacola"" target=""_blank"">Coca-Cola</a> ranks high too at 5 million. Apparently Facebook loves beverages. Sadly my drink of choice, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ice-Cold-Beer/89012171827"" target=""_blank"">Ice Cold Beer</a>, doesn't even break 1 million fans. Perhaps this has something to do with the large proportion of Facebookers who are still under 21.</p>
<p><br />Indeed, tween tastes do seem to rule when it comes to Facebook fandom. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/twilight"" target=""_blank"">The Twilight Saga</a> is far and away the top-ranked literary work with 5 million fans. That's almost three times as popular as <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheBible"" target=""_blank"">The Bible</a>. Though, Twilight was a book <em>and</em> a movie, so perhaps it's not quite a fair comparison. At least the Bible still outranks <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/playboy"" target=""_blank"">Playboy</a>.</p>
<p><br />It seems Sex and Drugs are no-nos on Facebook since neither even has a page, but Rock and Roll lives on. With 2.1 million fans, the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/JonasBrothers#!/JonasBrothers?v=wall"" target=""_blank"">Jonas Brothers</a> are bigger than <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Beatles?ref=search&amp;sid=5737714.2627360151..1"" target=""_blank"">The Beatles</a>--but just barely. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/elvis"" target=""_blank"">Elvis</a> lags farther behind. I will say, as a resident of Brooklyn, where hipness is measured in direct proportion to obscurity, I'm rather proud that the most successful band I admit to being a fan of--<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/deathcabforcutie#!/deathcabforcutie?v=wall"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>--has only 300,000 fans.</p>
<p><br />On the whole, I'm not sure whether these numbers should make me feel optimistic about the future of the Facebook generation. They're obviously sleep-deprived, given the popularity of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Staying-Up-Late/41734912516"" target=""_blank"">Staying up Late </a>and<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-SLEEP/73330003836"" target=""_blank""> I ? Sleep</a>. Perhaps it's all that Starbucks caffeine. The fact that <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Getting-Paid/89032487949#!/pages/Getting-Paid/89032487949?v=wall"" target=""_blank"">Getting Paid</a> has more fans than <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/No-Homework/47263947366"" target=""_blank"">No Homework</a> seems to be a good sign for tomorrow's workforce. But these kids may just be planning to spend their days watching <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/youtube"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Texting/86242351742"" target=""_blank"">Texting</a>, counting on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Finding-Money-In-Your-Pocket/140549715510"" target=""_blank"">Finding Money In Your Pocket</a>.</p>

<p><br />So let's say you've incorporated your nonprofit, gotten your 501(c)3 status, and already built enough equity in your COKE name not to change it. (In my hypothetical world, Coca-Cola hasn't sued your pants off.) What's an org to do?</p>
<p><br />The first thing to consider is avoiding your acronym. At Big Duck, we tend to discourage the use of acronyms in general anyway, so maybe COKE should use the full name.</p>
<p><br />Hey, look! The full name web address, coalitionforordinarykidseducation.org, is available. And no wonder. It's a terrible option.</p>
<p><br />Even with a shorter name, COKE could run into URL registration problems. Big Duck wasn't even late to the website party, and yet someone else had already taken <a href=""http://www.bigduck.com"" target=""_blank"">bigduck.com</a>. And because the harpsichordist who owns the site is only interested in selling it to us for gobs of cash, we use bigducknyc.com instead. Easy enough.</p>
<p><br />Your Coalition for Ordinary Kids' Education organization has a few options. If you're really keen on your acronym, perhaps cokeboston.org would work.</p>
<p><br />You might also decide that a shortened version of your full name would work. OrdinaryKidsEd.org might be a good option. It also might position you as a leader in the educational space for ordinary kids. Well done.</p>
<p><br />(Perhaps you noticed that I threw some capital letters into that URL. Caps don't make a lick of difference in the web address itself, but if you need to write it out on your marketing materials, sometimes the capital letters can help something read a little bit better.)</p>
<p><br />Maybe all of you at the Coalition for Ordinary Kids' Education have a tagline you like: Get wicked smart. GetWickedSmart.org could well be your winning URL.</p>
<p><br />The point is, with a little creative thinking, you'll have some good, strategically sound URL options available to you.</p>
<p><br />Once you've settled on a URL people are happy with, don't forget to take a step back and look at it from another perspective. There's an old Web Legend about a company called Powergen, which had an Italia office, resulting in a rather unfortunate web address when they shoved the two words together. Whether any of this is true, or if Powergen even had an Italia office, is a matter of some debate. And I'm sure you'll be surprised to hear that reliable information on the World Wide Web can be difficult to track down.</p>
<p><br />But fear not, nonprofiteers. Go forth and snag yourself a lovely dot-org with confidence.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1","","","","s-one-url-pickle","","","",

Much to my mother's relief, I opted to show my solidarity with cancer survivors by coloring my hair; not quite going the full monty of shaving it all off. In selecting a color, I admit I wanted something worthy of the baldacious title. After some spirited debate amongst those in the salon, we opted for ""red-violet-violet"" streaks.<br />My friend and colleague Todd Whitley, VP of eMarketing at The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, was there chronicling the event and posting pics to the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/baldacious"" target=""_blank"">Totally Baldacious Facebook community</a> of nearly 14,000 fans.

Here's why.</p>","<p>Earlier today, President Obama signed historic health reform legislation into law. While the media's attention is, understandably and rightfully, focused on the legislation itself, some of us nonprofit communications nerds are also watching how the administration is getting the word out.</p>
<p><br />Shortly after the bill was signed, President Obama sent an email inviting me (and, oh, a few other million people) to be 'co-signers' of the bill.

Here's why.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />Most folks who are working toward an important goal are focused on what success looks like: getting the bill passed and signed into law, in this case; or reaching a certain membership goal, let's say; or getting the website launched. Any communications-related efforts will generally be put toward achieving the goal. But how many organizations think about and prep for what happens when success is achieved?</p>
<p><br />In a matter of days, I'm guessing, the Obama administration hustled to build these pages into the <a href=""http://www.barackobama.com/index.php?splash=false"" target=""_blank"">'mybo' website </a> and probably even designed the t-shirt to boot. Like good fundraisers, they added in the tried-and-true ask after an action has been taken.They wrote the email blast, figured out who'd get it, and got everything coded and ready to launch as soon as the Presidential pen hit the page. Good stuff.</p>
<p><br />For nonprofits, I think the big communications lesson here is about looking beyond the moment of success and thinking about what comes next. How can you leverage that success and make it even bigger? Get an ask in there? Get people to take another action- perhaps capturing some new email addresses along the way?</p>
<p><br />Once your nonprofit's new website is live, how will you let your audiences know? How will you get them to visit, interact, and come back? Once the New York Times quotes your CEO, who will you send the clip to? How will you leverage it to reach your target audiences and move them to act?</p>
<p>I'm excited to see the long view principal in action here- it's so rare resources are put to use this way- particularly in a context where you could say the job was complete. I'm even more excited to see someone (perhaps you?) wearing a health care reform t-shirt.</p>
<p><br />Or if your tastes usually wander onto the inappropriate side of things, you might choose a different t-shirt to celebrate health care reform. Some of you probably heard that gaffe-tastic Vice President Joe Biden dropped an f-bomb after his <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/23/a-big-fucking-deal-bidens_n_509927.html"" target=""_blank"">official remarks</a>, which introduced the president. Well, a <a href=""http://www.zazzle.com/big+fing+deal+gifts"" target=""_blank"">t-shirt</a> has commemorated that occasion as well.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","big-fing-deal","","","",

<p><br />As you watch the videos, consider the criteria we had in mind in making our selections:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message</strong>: Is the message clear? Does the message take an original angle on the topic? Do you know what the video seeks to communicate and what it wants you to do?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use of Video</strong>: Did the organization take advantage of the video medium? Could the message have been more effectively communicated using any other medium?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Video</strong>: Was the video made well? Did they use good video technique including framing, sound, visual interest, etc?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: Did the style of the video catch your attention? Did you see something original and exciting?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Appeal</strong>: Did you feel connected to the characters and content? Did you identify with the organization and its cause? Would you be compelled to act on behalf of the organization?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />There's a lot to learn from these finalists. If you are new to video storytelling, you should watch these videos and start thinking about how to do more in this powerful communications channel. And if your organization already produces videos, how do you think yours would measure up? <br />Good luck to all of the finalists and may the best videos win!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1","","","","your-turn-vote-best-nonprofit-videos-year","","","",

<ol>
<li><strong>Build your list</strong>. Ask for cell phone numbers on all contact and reply forms. Invite Facebook fans and Twitter followers to share their cell phone numbers with you too. As you build your list, be sure to follow best practices regarding privacy and opt-in/opt-out language. The <a href=""http://mmaglobal.com/main"" target=""_blank"">Mobile Marketing Association</a> offers some great advice and suggested language.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your audience</strong>. Like with any new technology or communications tool, make sure it is something your audience wants before you jump in. iPhone apps are cool, but will your supporters really use one?</li>
<li><strong>Don't assume you know who is using mobile</strong>. <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/12-Wireless-Internet-Use.aspx?r=1"" target=""_blank"">With mobile use growing fastest among African-Americans</a> (who are also the most active users of mobile technology), mobile may be a great equalizer in the digital divide<!--break--></li>
<li><strong>Expand your definition of mobile beyond texting</strong>. Does your website look good on smart phones? Can someone become a fan of your Facebook page on their cell phone or check in to your organization's office on a location-based network like <a href=""http://foursquare.com/"" target=""_blank"">foursquare</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Consider the medium</strong>. A mobile campaign may be more likely to generate an immediate response, but it can be harder to build ongoing relationships with supporters if they view mobile interactions to get information, donate, or take action as one-time transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Don't think about mobile in isolation</strong>. Start by plotting out how it fits in with the rest of your communications. In the 2009 year-end fundraising season, several nonprofit organizations followed an email appeal with a text message to reinforce ""the ask.""</li>
<li><strong>Sharpen your short messaging skills on Twitter</strong>. While you have 20 more characters with mobile messages, the 140-character limit on Twitter can train you in being succinct. And pithy.</li>
<li><strong>Once you get started with mobile, put the call-to-action everywhere</strong>. Like your website URL, if you offer a way for people to connect with you via text, be sure to publish your keyword and shortcode at events, on your website, on your Facebook pages, in YouTube videos, on radio PSAs or podcasts, etc. While you're at it, consider buying any misspellings of your keywords too. (Not sure what those words mean? <a href=""http://www.punchkickinteractive.com/mobile/resources/glossary.php"" target=""_blank"">Great mobile glossary here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Put communications best practices into action</strong>. When people donate via text, say thank you and build on the connection. Let them know how the campaign did and send them other information (if they opt-in) about your great work.</li>
<li><strong>Measure and test</strong>. The beauty of texting is that it is incredibly measurable. Set goal metrics up front, measure throughout, and refine your approach as needed. You can also conduct tests to determine what spurs the greatest response from your list--for example, does a message requesting recipients to text in a response perform better than one that asks them to visit a URL?</li>

Most folks seem to struggle to get to the minutae of their projects while, at the same time, maintaining some bigger-picture point of view. It goes like this:</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />The long view:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I should be monitoring emerging communications techniques and best practices</li>
<li>I should know what my peers in the field are up to</li>
<li>I should be reading/attending stuff that makes me better at my job and helps my career</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt""><br />In the trees:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I should be planning my communications out in advance more and working less reactively</li>
<li>I should be translating the content of the meetings I participate in into internal and external communications and action items</li>
<li>I should be making sure my workload and resources are aligned: that the work we're planning is realistic given staff, budget, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-2332"" title=""DSC_4752"" src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/sites/default/files/images/blog/DSC_4752-300x199.jpg"" alt=""Are you taking time to look at the big picture?"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /><br />Are you taking time to look at the big picture?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">In the trenches:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I should be listening to the buzz and participating in the chatter about us online every day</li>
<li>I should be doing multivariate tests on my key website pages</li>
<li>I should be customizing my emails, ask strings and other digital content for key audiences (segmenting)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br />Seems like doing all of these things (and a million other things that could be noted at each of these levels) might be impossible for any person not endowed with superpowers.</p>
<p><br />But it's a particularly crazy time we communicators are living in: we've got all this cool free/cheap technology that lets us do things that would have been impossible or unaffordable years ago (but still take time)- and we've got even less time to allocate to them than ever as staff gets stretched thin due to budgeting.</p>
<p><br />Some nonprofit communicators spend all of their time mired in the day-to-day details and lose sight of the bigger picture, missing huge opportunities along the way. Others spend so much time planning and moving projects forward they never really get their hands dirty with details that might really benefit their organization, like testing or segmentation.</p>
<p><br />There's got to be a better way to work.</p>
<p><br />Seems to me the way to tackle this dilemma is to create structures that force you to move through all layers of your work at appropriate intervals. For instance, what if you tried to spend:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours a week devoted to tending the long view (watching and learning from other nonprofits, monitoring best practices, reading up)</li>
<li>10 hours a week devoted to the treetops (budgeting, planning, conducting research, organizing, and managing)</li>
<li>27 hours a week in the trenches (writing, designing, dealing with vendors, testing, coding, social media production, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Because we all know you work a 40 hour week, right? Cough, cough.)</p>
<p><br />In truth, most people get caught up in the trenches and find it hard to get their heads out of the details and look around. But starting with the bigger picture, or, at least visiting it periodically, might be a real game-changer. You'll be better equipped to respond to 'what if' questions, build buy-in for change when you see it coming, and understand how your situation compares with others more realistically.</p>
<p><br />How do you do it?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","bring-your-shovel-and-your-jet-pack","","","",

<div>
<p>On a recent weekend, my wife and I attended a grassroots fundraiser thrown by a friend of ours, who is a participant in the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team in Training program.</p>
<p><br />For more and more organizations, volunteer-led fundraisers have become an important revenue stream.&nbsp;<a href=""http://lls.org/hm_lls"" target=""_blank"">The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>&nbsp;has created a powerful fundraising mechanism with its&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.teamintraining.org/"" target=""_blank"">Team in Training</a>&nbsp;<a href=""#_msocom_2""></a>program, a mechanism that many other nonprofits strive to emulate.</p>
<p><br />According to the website, Team in Training got its start in 1988, when a fine fellow named Bruce Cleland formed a running team that raised funds and trained to run the New York City Marathon in honor of Cleland's daughter Georgia, a leukemia survivor. Thirty-eight runners raised $322,000. Since those days, Team in Training has grown enormously, with more than 40,000 runners, walkers, cyclists, hikers, and triathletes participating in marathons, triathlons, hiking adventures, and bicycle rides to benefit the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Not too shabby.</p>
<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-2362"" title=""IMG_1093"" src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/sites/default/files/images/blog/IMG_1093-300x225.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1093"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br />staying on brand without knowing anything about the brand</p>
<p>Team in Training participants are required to raise a certain dollar amount, depending upon the event they sign up for. Our friend, for example, who will be doing a hike across the Grand Canyon, has to raise $6,400. What he doesn't raise, he has to cover with his own money. So he has some real incentive to raise some cash. He'd gotten donations and commitments from a few people, but he was still coming up short.</p>
</div>
<p>When he started thinking about throwing a fundraising event, he played to his strengths. He knows a lot of talented musicians, particularly singers. Hence, ""Cabaret for a Cure"" was born. He called in favors, found a space, scrounged together raffle prizes, and promoted the heck out of it.</p>
<p><br />For nonprofits, grassroots fundraisers can be a real wildcard, from a branding point of view. Nonprofits need their volunteers' excitement and fundraising moxie. But how will that grandfather five states away use your logo? Will that enthusiastic volunteer use profanity (or other language inappropriate to your organization's personality) due to her passion? Giving up control of your communications like that can feel very unsettling.</p>
<p><br />The Team in Training program has one solution: give the volunteers lots of decorative materials. Our friend had a roll of large, perforated Team in Training logos made out of garbage bag-type plastic that he could just tear off and put up. Brilliant. He'd created signs for his specific event that appeared to have been made from a template provided, I assume, by the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Easy. He had brochures, pins, even shirts to give away. Generous.</p>
<p><br />I should perhaps point out that our friend is the ideal person to host a grassroots fundraiser, not only because of his dedication to the cause, but also because he pays attention to every detail. He doesn't work in marketing and may or may not know about branding, but he wanted everything to look just right.</p>
<p><br />Team in Training materials are purple. So he embraced purple for all aspects of his event. He put purple tablecloths on the tables. He filled purple balloons with helium. He baked cupcakes and gave them purple frosting. He even asked the performers to wear purple on stage.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/b10483d8ec862bbbf244b5ec97137b90/files/team.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br /><br />From a purely marketing and communications standpoint, our friend should win a special award from the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. With any grassroots event, there are many places where the branding can go awry. But this guy nailed it just by following his instinct and paying attention to detail. Every nonprofit would be lucky to have a grassroots fundraising volunteer like this on their team.</p>
<p><br />But of course the real measure of success for a good fundraising event is whether it met its financial goals. Yes, it did.</p>
<p><br />And my wife and I got a pretty enjoyable evening out of it too.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1066%2","","","","grassroots-and-brand-unheard","","","",

But it doesn't have to stop there.</p>
<p><br />Last fall, Big Duck worked with <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a> (PPMD), the largest nonprofit organization in the United States focused entirely on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (a rare but fatal genetic disorder), to create an integrated, multi-channel year-end campaign, using emails, Facebook messages, a YouTube video, text messages, web banners, and other online tools (along with a direct mail piece) to reinforce and amplify the campaign's message.</p>
<p><br />My fellow Duck, <a href=""/about/team/elizabeth_ricca/"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Ricca</a>, will share some insights about the campaign in a post later this week. For now, here's a closer look at some of the elements of PPMD's 2009 campaign, as well as some interesting ideas for nonprofit fundraisers on creating a successful integrated campaign, whether at year end or year-round.</p>
<p><br />1. <strong>Start with a strong concept. </strong>Before figuring out how many emails to send out and the timing of each message--or whether or not to add in a new channel like Twitter--we figured out the big idea we wanted the campaign to communicate. For PPMD's the concept behind the entire campaign was ""Always remember"" -- an idea that strikes an emotional chord with its donors.</p>
<p><br />2. <strong>Cut through the clutter.</strong> As the centerpiece of the campaign, we created a non-traditional greeting card, designed to stand out from the slew of coupons, letters, and catalogs that take over our mailboxes at home. The card unfolded accordion-style to reveal the following message: ""Always remember...to hold...to hope...to fight...to give."" The final panel made the ask--""This holiday, give from the heart.""--and gave potential donors two ways to give: through a unique URL (<a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/hope"" target=""_blank"">ParentProjectMD.org/hope</a>) or using the enclosed reply envelope.</p>
<p><br />3. <strong>Use multiple messages to reinforce the big idea.</strong> Rather than send out just one or two emails, we wound up sending out six messages, starting around Thanksgiving and finishing up early in the new year.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1ab99d619c9075d102e04245685cd687/files/ppmd_card_263x300.jpg"" width=""263"" height=""300"" /><br />Parent Project Muscular Dystophy's non-traditional direct mail card<br /><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/giving_thanks_2009"" target=""_blank""></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/giving_thanks_2009"" target=""_blank"">Message 1</a>: Sent right before Thanksgiving, asking people to share what they are thankful for by posting a comment on the Executive Director's blog and/or note on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/holiday_challenge_2009"" target=""_blank"">Message 2</a>: Sent in early December, timed to arrive in sync with the mailed greeting card. The email message was designed to use the same creative and messaging as the greeting card, but it also included a special matching gift offer from a grandparent of a boy with Duchenne. The amount for the match was $15,000, reflecting both what the donor could give and what the community was likely to raise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/holiday_challenge_2009_up date"" target=""_blank"">Message 3</a>: Sent a week later, and added at the last minute when two other donors stepped forward with an offer to increase the match, jumping the total from $15,000 to $60,000.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/give_together_2009"" target=""_blank"">Message 4</a>: Sent in mid-December from the original donor behind the matching gift campaign, sharing his personal story and reasons for issuing the match, and thanking the other families who have joined him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/last_chance_2009"" target=""_blank"">Message 5</a>: Sent on December 30 as a ""last chance"" reminder to give. Maybe it was the appeal of the tax write-off, or simply the final nudge some donors needed, but this message generated the most revenue of the entire series.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageNavigator/thanks_2009"" target=""_blank"">Message 6</a>: Sent in early January to thank the community (donors and non-donors alike) and share the results of the community's online efforts to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />4. <strong>Dive into other channels to capture attention of the entire community.</strong> Not everyone in PPMD's community is on their mailing or email lists (and those that are may or may not open the messages), so we turned other channels to support and promote the campaign. We created banners for PPMD's <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org"" target=""_blank"">main</a> and <a href=""http://community.parentprojectmd.org"" target=""_blank"">community </a>sites, posted a <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=fight_to_end_duchenne_2009"" target=""_blank"">simple splash page</a> pushing visitors to the donation form for the last two weeks of December, and encouraged PPMD to share campaign progress via Facebook. PPMD also sent out reminders and a fundraising ask to all those who had donated via SMS/text in previous campaigns. Finally, we created a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/parentprojectmd#p/u/5/2QDZMdNK-Mk"" target=""_blank"">video version of the direct mail appeal</a> (greeting card) that featured a link to the donation page and was distributed through the PPMD's YouTube channel and via Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p><br />So there you have it--integrated fundraising strategy in four bullets. Has your organization come across any great techniques for driving donations online? Share in the comments.</p>

Would donors cut back in the face of a still-floundering economy? Would they give less, or just not give at all?</p>
<p><br />As it turns out, most nonprofits did encounter a decline in overall revenue, according to the <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/Online-Giving-Grows-but-at-a/65089/"" target=""_blank"">Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual survey</a>. But many saw a distant light at the end of the economic tunnel in the form of online fundraising, with overall online revenue up 14% from 2008 according to <a href=""http://my.convio.com/forms/2010ConvioOnlineNonprofitBenchmarkStudyGuide"" target=""_blank"">Convio's 2010 Online Nonprofit Benchmark Study</a>.</p>
<p><br /><a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=nws_index&amp;cvridirect=true"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a> (PPMD) , a long-time client of Big Duck's, saw the story of the sector overall reflected in the returns from their integrated annual campaign--<strong>slight overall decline; big jump in online revenue</strong>. But their results tell another story, too, about <strong>the importance building strong relationships with your donors year-round, not just at year end</strong>.</p>
<p><br />Since 2007, we Ducks have worked with PPMD to create an integrated year-end campaign. At the core of the campaign is a non-traditional direct mail appeal (holiday card) and a series of emails (with supporting online components, like custom donation pages, blog and Facebook posts, and banners), united by a creative concept that plays out in the visuals and language. PPMD works to end Duchenne, a fatal genetic disorder that affects boys, so this year's concept centered on a simple and compelling message: always remember. For a friend or family member of a boy with Duchenne, messages like this one are emotional reminders to cherish the time they have and to support organizations like PPMD.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/3bc85c0c1aabd01ea3d869e3816a0989/files/ppmd_splashpage_300x237.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""237"" /><br />Splash page posted at the end of December to trigger gifts from web visitors</p>
<p><br />The email series started with a Thanksgiving cultivation message from Pat, PPMD's founding president, timed to hit inboxes just before the holiday card, which mailed the week of Thanksgiving, hit mailboxes. A week later, Pat kicked off the appeal series by introducing a $15,000 matching gift from a PPMD supporter and grandparent of a boy with Duchenne. All according to plan so far--but then PPMD's donor community started to shake things up.</p>
<p><br />Within a few days, a family from PPMD's community called: they wanted to see a more ambitious fundraising challenge, and offered an additional $30,000 to make it happen. A day later, another family stepped up with a similarly generous (and unrelated) offer to increase the match by a further $15,000. In just a few days, with just one email, the challenge match leapt from a conservative $15,000 to a decidedly ambitious $60,000. Exciting, and a touch nerve-wracking: <strong>could the rest of the donor community rise to the challenge?</strong></p>
<p><br />They could, and they did--and then some. PPMD raised over $115,000 online during the campaign, nearly double the proffered match. Total online revenue reflected a whopping 88% increase from the previous year's total.</p>
<p><br />But what about direct mail performance? Did we end up robbing Peter to pay Paul? Apparently not--although direct mail revenue declined about 22% relative to 2008 (a decrease almost full offset by the increase in online giving), the number of gifts stayed about the same. PPMD's direct mail donors still gave in the same numbers, just not at the same level as previous years. Not too surprising, given the state of the economy. The real increase for PPMD came in the number of online donors--up 58% from the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p><br />They say that in hard times, you find out who your friends are, and the same can be true for nonprofits--when the fundraising climate is tough, you find out who your most loyal supporters are. And PPMD's case, those supporters turned out to be even more generous and enthusiastic than they (or we!) could have imagined.</p>
<p><br />Of course, this kind of response doesn't happen overnight--PPMD works hard all year to create connections donors and other audiences, from managing a custom community site that gives their audiences a place to connect 24/7 to hosting an annual conference that brings the whole community together for three days to share experiences and learn from the experts.</p>
<p><br />The lesson we learned? Don't underestimate the power of your community. PPMD's supporters pushed us to make a bolder ask, and the campaign flourished as a result.</p>

<p><br />Rebecca got up early and traveled all the way to Penn Station to get real Krispy Kremes. <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/team/sonny_mui"" target=""_blank"">Sonny</a> had schmoozed an employee at a local lunch joint with a good burger to prepare them for our arrival (and get the ""all clear"" to bring outside food, i.e. the donuts, into the restaurant).</p>
<p><br />Sonny and Rebecca ordered the burgers for us.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/66f475e88e25203705cbfc6c914018d0/files/luther1.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>

<p>The restaurant, Choice, did a remarkable job accommodating our madness, even bringing the bunless burgers out on a platter.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/66f475e88e25203705cbfc6c914018d0/files/luther4.jpg"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></p>

<p>So how were they? In a word: delicious. The salty/sweet combination was a pleasure most of us expected. But Luther Vandross's brilliance in creating this burger lies in his use of Krispy Kreme donuts. Truth be told, they're mostly air (and fat and sugar, of course). But they don't actually have that much flavor.</p>
<p>In other words, it still tasted like a burger. It wasn't overwhelmed by the sweetness or weight of a more substantial donut. It was a delicious bacon-cheddar cheeseburger. With donut buns! It tasted much better than any of us expected. Even those of us who thought it would be good had no idea just how good it would be.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/66f475e88e25203705cbfc6c914018d0/files/luther6.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /><br /><br />Most of us also agreed that it's not something we'd ever eat again. At 1,550 calories (approximately), and god knows how much fat and sugar, it would be exceedingly unwise to eat it more than once in your life. And it's probably wise to remember that Luther Vandross suffered from diabetes, struggled with his weight, and ultimately died from a stroke probably caused by hypertension.</p>
<p><br />As <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/team/elizabeth_ricca"" target=""_blank"">Liz</a> pointed out, it was the first time in the more than two years she's worked at Big Duck that we actually closed the office over lunch and went out as a group. Initially, I didn't think there was much of a lesson to be gleaned from our Luther Burger experience and, in general, we like to provide useful tips to our nonprofit readership on the Duck Call blog.</p>

<p>But once we came out of our sugar-and-meat comas (and yes, the aftermath of our lunch was quite drowsy indeed), it hit us...</p>

When I got to the specialist's office for a pre-test consultation, I felt uncomfortable: the waiting room was cramped, the receptionists were surly, and the grey office walls were full of taped-up signs that like, ""You'll be held responsible personally for all copays,"" and other generally aggressive statements. There were no smiling nurses, no soothing fish tanks, no pictures of vacation destinations- nothing that hinted, particularly, of humanity at all. The doctor was nice enough but rather perfunctory. This place was all business- and frankly, it was a downer.</p>
<p><br />As I walked out of the office, I thought without hesitation that I'd find another doctor to do the test. Why? Because nothing about my experience there made me feel this doctor was a caring professional I'd want to have treat me- or even administer tests to me. In that office, patients are patients- not people- and there's something diminishing about that. Don't get me wrong- I didn't need fancy wallpaper or a pedicure while I waited to see the doctor to feel good about it- just a smile, or perhaps a ""Have a nice day.""</p>
<p><br />It reminded me of a social service organization where I once attended a meeting. The organization's large building was lit badly, had peeling paint on the walls, featured lots of taped up notices, and generally felt grungy. Some of the problems were probably due to underfunding, but others were more the result of neglect and lack of respect for the space itself. Both the staff and clients I met there seemed cranky- and it was easy to see how uninspiring it was to spend any time in that place, no matter how great their services might be.</p>
<p><br />By contrast, I recently toured the cancer center at <a href=""http://www.nwhc.net/"" target=""_blank"">Northern Westchester Hospital</a>, a new client of Big Duck's. Smiling receptionists greeted everyone who walked through the door, interesting art hung on the walls, rooms were nicely lit, walls had been painted in soothing earth-toned colors, mellow music played in the background, and there was even an art therapy station where patients sit and color or paint while they wait for their appointments.</p>

<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-2472"" title=""DSC_4590"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/DSC_4590-300x199.jpg"" alt=""A corner of the caregiver's room at Northern Westchester Hospital- a place designed to provide comfort and support"" width=""300"" height=""199"" /></p>
<p><br />Inside the women's imaging center at Northern Westchester you can make yourself a cup of coffee. And if you're admitted as a patient, you can request chicken soup (or whatever else you fancy), and they'll bring it up to your room, no matter what time you want it. You can change the art on the wall of your room. You can get acupuncture! The list goes on and on. What's clear is that Northern Westchester values not only the quality of the medical care they provide (the top-tier doctors there are a given), but also the quality of the patient's overall experience. Their leadership realizes that experience can be impacted by any number of variables- not just the doctors who treat you.</p>
<p><br />In the for-profit world, these experiences (positive and negative) are called ""customer service,"" and there's often a staff person responsible for overseeing and monitoring them, but in most nonprofits there's no obvious parallel term or role. Some organizations treat clients, members, donors, and other audiences with highest regard, while others don't. When they do, it's often because this type of thoughtfulness and care for all aspects of an individual's experience are reflective of their values, and they understand in-person experiences that can deeply affect how people feel. In fact, I've been in some spectacularly underfunded organizations that have creatively used found objects for furniture, client-produced artwork on the walls, and other free or low-cost items to create spaces that are truly inspirational. It sets a tone that communicates a lot about how the organization approaches their work and feels about the people it serves.</p>
<p><br />Investing in the in-person experiences your clients, members, donors, volunteers, and even staff have when they enter your facility is time and money well spent. You'd be happier walking down a hallway with a mural painted on it then a drab grey wall, wouldn't you? Or being greeted by someone who looks you in the eye and smiles? Yes, it requires an investment of time and, in some cases, money that many organizations feel they can't make. But when you factor in the greater staff retention, better possible outcomes, and general sense of enthusiasm that a welcoming, caring space generates, it's hard to argue that this isn't time well-spent.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1,1408%2","","","","caring-through-wallpaper-and-other-adventures-space","","","",

Read more about Brandraising and other great articles at <em><a href=""http://www.causeplanet.org/index.php"" target=""_blank"">causeplanet.org</a>.</em></em></p>
<p><br />It hit me last night when I saw a commercial for American Idol. The cast must have read Sarah Durham's new book called <em>Brandraising</em>. I knew Durham and her New York agency colleagues at <a href=""http://www.causeplanet.org/articles/www.bigducknyc.com"">Big Duck </a>were hip, but her guidelines for success have even reached pop culture. The parallels are remarkable, so hear me out. This taxonomy will make you realize just how relevant <em>Brandraising </em>is and why you should be reading on for the benefit of your own organizationand, at the very least, help add credibility to the time you have invested in watching television.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. <em>Brandraising</em>: The overview</p>
<p><br />Idol: ""Decide what kind of performer you want to be, what genre, and stick with it.""</p>
<p><br />Durham explains that her model starts with the ""<em>organizational level</em>,"" which makes up the top seven elements of the brandraising pyramid, because they direct all aspects of the organization's work. These elements are the vision, mission, values, objectives, audiences, positioning and personality. The ""<em>identity level"" </em>is what most people think of as where the branding takes place.This is where the visual identity and the messaging platform play out. The third and bottom level of the pyramid is the ""<em>experiential level</em>,"" which consists of the variety of channels through which nonprofits can communicate with their donors, clients and stakeholders, such as print, online, on air, in person and mobile. (A visual of this overview can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.josseybass.com/go/sarahdurham"" target=""_blank"">www.josseybass.com/go/sarahdurham</a>, using the password <em>professional</em>.)</p>
<p>The judges on the American idol show repeat the same messages every week in hopes that contestants will latch on to their advice and rise to the competition. Advice ranges from ""Think about who you are and be consistent from week to week,"" to ""You've got a unique look and sound, which makes you a compelling performer."" These remarks by the judges could pass as organizational and identity level advice in Durham's model where she addresses vision, values, positioning and personality, as well as visual identity and messaging platform.</p>
<p><br />2. <em>Brandraising</em>: The long view</p>
<p><br />Idol: ""Are you in it to win it?""</p>
<p><br />Durham emphasizes the importance of the ""<em>long view""</em> and how this position can address common barriers and empower nonprofit leaders to weather challenges and act with planning and agility. Drawbacks of the short view that some nonprofits find themselves taking include working reactively, which obviously requires more budget and time. For example, waiting until a piece needs to be developed for a looming deadline means crisis communication and expenditures. Rather than succumb to the accidental branding activities described in chapter two, savvy nonprofits save money and time by regularly monitoring peer organizations, managing information saturation and reinforcing the big idea.</p>
<p><br />In American Idol, the judges always ask the contestants ""Are you in it to win it?"" In other words, your focus on the long view or end goal will help you concentrate on the importance of planning and practicing for each performance.</p>
<p><br />3. Brandraising: Audience-centric communications</p>
<p><br />Idol: ""You finally connected with the audience tonight.""</p>
<p>According to Durham, many organizations make the mistake of becoming self-absorbed in the process of resolving who they are as an organization when crafting messages to their donors. Durham encourages nonprofits to balance navel contemplation with a focus on ""<em>audience-centric communications."" </em>When you plan on sending out a direct mail or email campaign, do you know which your audience prefers? Are you tapping into the personal motivations of why people give to your organization? Durham reminds readers that people generally give because they are moved to do so and they know it's the right thing to do. She challenges readers to recreate that feeling in a donor.</p>
<p><br />American Idol contestants who are doing well at this late stage in the game can obviously sing well and have great stage presence, but what contributes to that presence is a genuine connection with the audience and responding to how they vote.</p>
<p><br />4. Brandraising: Prepare for the mobile future<br />Idol: ""Text a vote for your favorite American Idol""</p>
<p><br />Durham reminds readers that fundraising by mobile phone is still in its early stages, but it is here to stay. There are enough early success stories by other organizations, as well as examples of people rising up to meet the support needed in the wake of natural disasters, such as the recent one in Haiti. Whether or not your organization is ready to launch a mobile phone campaign, it's not too early to begin collecting numbers for the future.</p>
<p><br />According to Telewatcher.com, on average, 33 million people are voting each week this season on the show. In February 2010, Causecast listed eight different numbers you could text to make donations in support of the Chilean earthquake aftermath. We all know that the American Red Cross has raised more than $32 million via text-to-give, and that mobile has proven very useful for emergency situations. What we didn't quite know was how it would apply to the rest of the nonprofit world. Communications and strategy agency, Cone, has helped shed a little bit of light on this topic with their two-question online survey. Causecast noticed the following right off of the bat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text2Give is maturing - 13 percent of respondents donated via text message following the Haiti earthquake, compared to only 6 percent from <a href=""http://www.coneinc.com/news/request.php?id=2614"" target=""_blank"">Cone's 2009 Consumer New Media Study</a>.</li>
<li>19 percent would rather text a donation to a cause or nonprofit organization than through other means (e.g.,write a check or donate online).</li>
<li>18 percent are now more likely to text a donation to their favorite nonprofit organization if it is an available option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for humoring me in this unlikely but useful comparison.

Mission statements, fundraising appeals, and grant proposals are just a few ways organizations use words to make their case. But communicating information graphically can be another powerful tool for nonprofits.Good infographics can illustrate ideas that might take pages to explain in writing. They function as a visual shorthand, clarifying relationships with a degree of immediacy and impact text just can't offer.</p>
<p>Effective graphics can be created for many types of information, but they are best suited for showing comparisons, structures, and processes. Figuring out what type of infographic is right for a project typically requires three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the story you want to tell.</li>
<li>Find the information that best tells the story.</li>
<li>Determine the form that most clearly displays that information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as with writing, information design must have a thesis statement. You need to know what you want your graphic to communicate and limit yourself to the data set that tells that story. (It should go without saying that your story must be a true one. The cardinal sin of information design is using visual treatments to misrepresent data.) Your story can be as simple as ""People need the services we offer,"" or ""Our programs make a difference."" But you must be able to articulate your point before you can determine what facts and form will communicate it best.</p>
<p>Once you know your story, you'll have to find the right data to support it. The need for a nonprofit's services could be shown in many ways: highlighting increases in program attendance, citing statistics on underlying social problems, explaining a unique approach, or showing the absence of similar organizations nearby. Think of which evidence will be most compelling for your audience.</p>
<p>The type of information you settle on will help determine the form of your final infographic. If you're showing how parts of a whole relate, a pie chart or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_map"" target=""_blank"">treemap</a> can do the job; when comparing quantities you may want to try a bar graph, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart"" target=""_blank"">bubble chart</a>, or pictograph; for changes over time, a timeline or area graph can work well. Systems and hierarchies may require more complex visual treatments, but the design should never overshadow the relationship you're trying to show.</p>
<p>An example of this process can be seen in a brochure Big Duck recently created for the <a href=""http://www.nyccharterschools.org"" target=""_blank"">New York City Charter School Center</a>. The Charter Center had gathered a wealth of data, but wasn't sure of the best way to use it. We worked together to figure out exactly what story (or, in this case, stories) they wanted to tell. The result was a series of 10 points that dispel common misconceptions about charter schools, many with an accompanying graphic to help get the point across.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/3ad33c757d7e917ef1b8953ee9d089cb/files/nyccsc_infofoldersmall_352x228_300x194.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""194"" /></p>
<p>Now, instead of asking parents and policy makers to wade through pages of written reports, the Charter Center can give them a tool to help them understand the issues at a glance. And, with audiences this busy, that can make all the difference.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","picture-s-worth-1000-words-information-graphics-nonprofits","","","",

Predatory psychopaths waiting to pounce. Strange, sweaty creatures emerging from the alleyways. People who've never been to New York sometimes have this idea that the city is only what they've seen in Martin Scorsese's <em>Taxi Driver</em>.</p>
<p><br />What you probably don't know is that <em>Taxi Driver</em> is actually an allegorical film about the internet. Shady characters, predators, sweaty teenage boys. You may try to claim that Scorsese made his film in 1976, back before there was an internet, but I'm telling you: he <em>knew</em>, man. He <em>knew</em>.</p>
<p><br />And social media has thrown users another wicked curveball. What about privacy? We're just supposed to put all of our information right out there? And Tweets--Tweets!--are now being indexed by both Google and the Library of Congress. Then the <em>New York Times</em> runs an article like <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/technology/17privacy.html?scp=1&amp;sq=facebook%20privacy&amp;st=cse"" target=""_blank"">this one</a>, or your best friend tells you about <a href=""http://pleaserobme.com/"" target=""_blank"">PleaseRobMe.com</a>, and all your fears of stolen identities and home theft are confirmed.</p>
<p><br />Still, don't let your privacy fears keep you from exploring the social media. Despite the strangers, curious acronyms, and strange technical mysteries, the internet can be a real community. Every community has its bad apples, of course, but in our travels, we've found social media participants to be quite generous.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />A few months ago, when Facebook opened up to users the option of vanity URLs, businesses had to wait three weeks before snagging one of their own. Three weeks in and ""BigDuck"" was long gone.</p>
<p><br />So when Facebook instituted a policy allowing every Facebook user to change their username once--and only once--our cruise director Farra sprung into action. She friended the gentleman with the BigDuck moniker, charmed his pants off (not literally, as far as we know) in that way only Farra can, and convinced him to give us his name. Fans can now find us at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bigduck"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/bigduck</a>, thanks to his generosity.</p>
<p><br />Something else you should remember, particularly if you're exploring social media on behalf of your nonprofit organization: most of the people who have ""liked"" your Facebook page or follow you on Twitter like you. They connect to your issue. They care about the cause. They don't actually want to hurt you.</p>
<p><br />So the social media are like New York City after all. As long as you don't do anything foolish--tweeting ""OMG, locks busted, alarms down, office closed til Tues!"" for example--it can be one of the friendliest places in the world.</p>
<p><br />Here's a general rule: if you wouldn't tell a stranger or mention it in front of your grandmother or index it for eternity on Google's massive servers, don't say it, post it, or tweet it.<br />Otherwise, fear not, nonprofiteers: socialize mediatastically.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1412%1","","","","gosh-social-media-are-actually-social","","","",

<p><br />Since I'm traveling for work (read: no children with me) I'm getting some great opportunities to read. In an earlier <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/summer-reading"" target=""_blank"">blog entry</a>, I outlined my summer reading list. What I didn't admit is that I a) read several books at a time and b) read in a feast-or-famine way. This week I'm feasting.</p>
<p><br />First, I've finished Kivl Leroux Miller's terrific ""Nonprofit Marketing Guide"", which just came out. Kivi's been offering real-world practical marketing help to nonprofits for years, and her book synthesizes a ton of useful content into roughly 200 easy to read pages. It outlines bigger-picture marketing principles and strategies but also gets detailed and tactical too. If you're new to nonprofit communications or an experienced communicator trying to build buy-in for change internally and in need of back up to make your case, it's a must-read. Your office definitely needs a copy.</p>
<p><br />At Fundraising Day San Francisco, I picked up a copy of Kim Klein's latest book, ""Reliable Fundraising in Unreliable Times"". Kim's a seasoned fundraiser and author we can all learn from, and man, her writing is clear and sharp. I'm still reading the book now but I can already hear myself recommending it to anyone that needs to create a sustainable fundraising program that can survive all types of economic weather.</p>
<p><br />While in the San Francisco, I popped in to the <a href=""http://www.thecjm.org/"" target=""_blank"">Contemporary Jewish Museum</a> for a quick look see. In the bookstore, I picked up ""Living Judaism: The Complete Guide to Jewish Belief, Tradition and Practice"", thinking it'd be a good addition to my household bookshelf. It's proving to a be a great primer for anyone interested in understanding Judaism (not just Heebs like me). What I love about it is that it doesn't assume a particular level of observance, which makes it very accessible no matter where you're coming from.</p>
<p><br />Lastly, lest you think I'm all about nonfiction, I'm now listening (yes, giving the eyes a break) to Stieg Larson's ""Girl who Played with Fire"". That's book 2 in the Millenium Series. (In New York everyone seems to be reading and talking about these books, but less so out here.) I can't say I'm digging it as much as I did book 1 (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""), but it's nice to read a compelling mystery by a stranger with a British accent when driving through the desert.</p>
<p><br />Oh- and did I mention that Beth Kanter and Allison Fine's book ""The Networked Nonprofit"" is coming out next week? I'll have to finish up something to make room for that one on the bookshelf.</p>
<p><br />So much good stuff to read.. so little time... sigh! What's on your shelf?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","reading-road","","","",

<p><br />Being British, I'm used to watching World Cup matches in big, beery crowds. It's all part of the fun: there's nothing quite like the camaraderie you get from watching your <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/jun/14/england-world-cup-chalkboard"" target=""_blank"">over-hyped, overpaid team</a> crash out of the tournament <em>yet</em> <em>again </em>with a large group of sweaty and disappointed strangers.</p>
<p><br />So as the World Cup approached this year and I realized I might not be able to find such a crowd in New York, I was dejected. ""After all,"" I thought, ""there can't be that many people in New York who want to go to the pub and bellow at the England soccer team at 10:00am on a weekday.""</p>
<p>As it turned out -- I needn't have worried. There are plenty of people in New York who want to do just that. All I had to do was find them, and with the help of friends and some googling, find them I did.</p>
<p>For nonprofits, finding supporters for your cause might sometimes seem about as difficult as finding British soccer fans in the Big Apple -- particularly if your cause is very specific.</p>
<p>But as I've seen this week, there's an audience out there for almost everything, it's just a question of finding them. One call to a friend led me to meet more soccer fan friends - asking your existing supporters to forward your latest online campaign could introduce you to many of their like-minded friends and family. A quick Google search led me to a bar full of fans - a quick search of Meet-ups and Facebook groups might reveal new prospects ready and eager to join your cause.</p>
<p>But be careful: finding your audience is only the first step. Just like the England team, if you don't deliver on the promises that lead new prospects to join your cause (like, oh say, being the best English team in the last 10 years or having a genuine chance at winning this thing), you'll quickly have a disappointed and potentially rowdy crowd on your hands...</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1","","","","finding-your-audience-lesson-world-cup","","","",

<p>At last night's event, Naveen shared some insight as to Foursquare's many uses and growth (over 8 million users to date) and Shelley offered excellent pointers for how her nonprofit has embraced Foursquare.

</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>You can use Foursquare to change people's behavior and inspire positive change. One of Foursquare's first badges was the ""<a href=""http://www.samerforzley.com/2010/02/19/how-to-unlock-the-gym-rat-badge-foursquare/"" target=""_blank"">gym rat</a>""--awarded to users who check into a gym at least 10 times in 30 days. In fact, Foursquare was started as a response to the question, ""H<span><span>ow can we get better at living in our cities?""</span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>A little competition can go a long way. Some people throw parties just to attract 50+ people to unlock the <a href=""http://www.swarmbadgeparty.com/"" target=""_blank"">swarm badge</a> or visit the same place again and again to become its <a href=""http://foursquare.com/help/#9"" target=""_blank"">mayor</a>. For the <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2009/12/29/calling-the-mayor/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Museum</a>, they see the competition of mayorship as a source of identity and pride. They actively discourage staff from becoming the mayor and are sure to introduce themselves to the mayor at events and through its blog.</li>

<ul>
<li>Not sure if Foursquare is right for your organization?

Not sure who someone is? Ignore their request. Don't want people to know where you are? Don't check-in there or be mindful of where you choose to share, when you do check-in. I have a friend who checks in to their ""shrink's office"" and while I love to know they are taking care of their mental health, I'm a bit surprised to see them sharing this with hundreds of their Foursquare friends.</li>

Or even staff people who have, as part of their job description, some responsibilities for creating or managing external communications?</p>
<p>Unlike for-profit businesses of comparable size, nonprofits don't typically hire people in communications jobs until the organization reaches a certain size: often somewhere around a $4 million operating budget or a staff well into the double digits.</p>
<p>In bigger organizations, communications people sometimes work in the development department (often reporting up to a ""Director of Advancement"" who's typically a fundraiser). Maybe several staff people take on various communications responsibilities within various departments. With little or no coordination between them, this can often result in duplicated efforts, conflicting messages, or other ""silo issues.""</p>
<p>At the end of a workshop Sarah Durham (Big Duck's principal and founder) gave recently for the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network in San Francisco, a participant asked her what she thinks is the optimal staffing structure for communications. In particular, should development people should have oversight for communications, or communications over development?</p>
<p>We've been stewing on this question for years and we can't say there's one ""right"" way to do it. As with most things, it depends... on the vision, mission, and objectives of the organization, on the types of audiences they are aiming to reach, and other variables. (Hey, if the answers were easy we'd all have them, right?)</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Questions around communications staffing have gotten even more complex in the past two years as it's become increasingly difficult for nonprofits to avoid participating in social media. Communications of all types increasingly require ongoing feeding and watering to be sustained, so somebody (hopefully somebody responsive and mission-minded) needs to have a job description that includes it.</p>
<p>After 16 years of observing how nonprofits manage communications, we Ducks aren't convinced that staffing structure is the real challenge. Instead, we think the more important question is <em>what type of culture does your organization have around communication?</em></p>
<p>In a nonprofit that truly values good communications,you'll find:</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">A mature, transparent culture around sharing information internally and externally.</h3>
<p>People know what their colleagues are working on and are clear about how their work relates, supports, and connects. In meetings, they offer updates about their work and leave thinking about what information should be shared internally and externally. They take the initiative to share rather than waiting to be told, and are trusted by leadership to share appropriately (rather than having to seek approval for everything they send out). A transparent exchange of information is encouraged, and people generally view their colleagues in other departments as allies.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">A defined budget for communications.</h3>
<p>Instead of scrimping together a few shekels to update the website on the down low, organizations that value communications budget for it. They have line items in every budget for staffing, printing, and other external communications support they might need (e.g. consultants, developers, etc).</p>
<p>It's also important to anticipate years that will require additional communications mojo (a major website overhaul, for example, or a new identity process) and budget for it proactively- perhaps seeking specific funds for the project.</p>
<p>If your nonprofit isn't there yet, I'd suggest beginning a conversation about communications with the folks who manage the budget by looking at how your peers do it and considering an appropriate percentage of your annual operating budget (perhaps 5%). Remember that effective online, printed, and other communications increase your visibility and reputation and reinforce your credibility, which helps your donors, programs audiences, and advocates feel better about connecting with and supporting you. It's a growth strategy- not navel-gazing.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Real, live human beings who are responsible for communications.</h3>
<p>Most nonprofits now realize they can't afford to ignore social media, but few have staffed for it. Bigger national and international organizations like the Red Cross or the Humane Society of the United States not only have communications staff people, they even have (several) folks devoted exclusively to social media. If your budget is too small for a dedicated communications person on staff, at least try to build communications tasks and responsibilities into other job descriptions (maybe your fundraiser can handle it?).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">A long view attitude.</h3>
<p>Instead of diving in to social media reactively or producing all sorts of materials with dubious ROI (return on investment), organizations with a healthy communications culture bite off what they can chew and focus on doing that well- not on doing everything. They keep an eye out for the latest trends, technologies, and tools that might affect their work, monitor how others in their area are communicating, and make refinements for the long haul, instead of working reactively. The ""long view"" is a concept outlined in detail in <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/how/book"" target=""_blank""><em>Brandraising</em></a>. It's about maintaining a look at the bigger picture, and not just working in the trenches constantly.</p>

<p>We did receive a handful of very spooky emails from ConEd which used words and phrases like ""fires"" and ""true crisis mode"".Maybe most alarming was ConEd's suggestion that we switch over to a generator, which we don't have: ""If you have an onsite generator, you should get on the generator power ASAP.""</p>
<p>Like most New Yorkers, we kept calm (sleepy in fact), drank some iced coffee and hoped for the best. Some folks took the opportunity to check-in to the <a href=""http://foursquare.com/venue/5372841"" target=""_blank"">Heatpocalypse 2010</a> on foursquare. And I saw at least five young men in our building grow long hair and eccentric facial hair in response to the crisis, sort of like they did in the 60s on a hot day:<object width=""425"" height=""344"" classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/zWXcjYNZais&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /><embed width=""425"" height=""344"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/zWXcjYNZais&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"" allowFullScreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" /></object></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've found that like most folks, we don't like to waste away in the heat. But, we also don't like to use energy we don't even know we're using. Simple steps can make a big difference and perhaps the most valuable tool to fighting wasteful power usage is awareness.</p>

All the ducks selected sites they've found in their personal web use that they think are particularly well designed.<a href=""/blog/?p=2785#results"">The results are below</a>, along with brief explanations why each duck made the pick he or she did.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />Although the sites chosen range widely in terms of purpose, content, and style, we did notice some common characteristics. Most, it turns out, reflect things we already account for in our own website designs, but it was gratifying to discover (even in this admittedly non-scientific way) how these considerations do in fact improve our online experience.<br />Here's what we found:<br /><strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>We think about nonprofits, even when we don't have to.</strong></strong> Five out of the 14 sites we picked belong to nonprofit organizations--not a design observation, but telling nonetheless. Of the rest, three deal with music or TV, two are news or media sites, two are technology-focused, and two are design or fashion sites. (My, what a connected, stylish, and well-informed bunch we are.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Simple navigation keeps sites manageable.</strong></strong> On average, each website chosen has only 5 or 6 items in the main navigation menu. The menu headings tend to be concise as opposed to clever, with 90% measuring in at just one or two words long.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Uncluttered layouts let content shine.</strong></strong> Though the designs are all quite different, each site here reflects an underlying sense of organization, visual hierarchy, and restraint. Even the graphic elements--branding, photos, subheading treatments, dividers--all generally work toward supporting the content, and design simply for the sake of decoration is kept to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Strong images make a big impact.</strong></strong> Nearly all of these sites use a single large photo, video, slideshow, or graphic on the homepage to call attention to the most important content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Searchability is key for a customized experience.</strong></strong> All but two of these sites include a keyword search, filters, tags, or other quick and easy way for visitors to find the information they feel is most interesting or relevant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>White space helps visitors focus.</strong></strong> Incorporating empty space within a layout prevents visitors from being overwhelmed and helps direct them to what's really important. Nine out of the 14 websites chosen make marked use of white space, resulting in pages that feel spacious and clean.</li>

Fine blog</a>), writing other books on networks and social change, and doing all sorts of neat related things.</p>
<p><br />The preface of their book includes this sage advice to its readers:<br /><br />""...we ask for one thing in exchange: for organizational leaders anxious to jump into the what and how of social media, please practice using the tools yourselves. It's the only way to discover social media's power to change the way we think and work. We also hope you will trust the people within your organization to do the same, and encourage them to connect with the world in positive, creative ways.""</p>
<p><br />Amen, sistas!</p>
<p><br />I know from personal experience how important practicing using these tools is. Likewise, I know that you have to entrust and empower your staff to do the same on your organization's behalf.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><br />I admit it: when I was first told about Facebook (by someone many years my junior), I just didn't get it. Share updates? Send messages? Share photos? Why not do that stuff via email? <em>Kids today</em>, I growled. (My first reaction was even worse with Twitter.)</p>
<p><br />And then I remembered Mr. Stewart. Mr. Stewart was an inspiring art history teacher I had in high school (I know! My high school actually had art history! And life drawing! How cool is that?). After a few months of studying art, we had to actually make some. In fact, we had to paint. And after an hour or so of trying to paint, I had a whole new level of respect and appreciation for the artists we were studying and their work. In fact, a whole new level of understanding opened up.</p>
<p><br />These days, when I hear about a new social media tool I try not to <em>poo poo</em> it. Instead, I sign up - and commit to using it for a trial period. I often begin by thinking that I'll use it for 3 months or so and then pop off if I hate it, which helps me stomach tackling it. And then it usually turns out that I love it.</p>
<p>These days, I'm convinced that Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and other social media are making both my personal and professional life better. (They're also eroding the line between the two - but that's a topic for another day, friends.)</p>
<p>Using these tools, even for just a few months, will help you understand them better - even if you choose to abandon them later. I find that exploring them via a hobby that you love (Golfing? Dancing? Sewing?) often helps, too.</p>
<p><br />So strip down and dive in: you might find the water's warmer than you think.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1412%1","","","","take-dip-refreshing-waters-social-media","","","",

I'm embedding their slides below--so do take a gander. Here are some of my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first question you should ask is not how long your video should be or how you'll come up with something so hot it puts the <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/blogPost/Charity-Lessons-From-the-Old/25663/"" target=""_blank"">Old Spice guy</a> to shame, but how does video relate to your mission?</li>
<li>It's not the number of views that count, but the eyeballs behind those views. Let the <em>goals </em>of your video and <em>who</em> you are trying to reach drive your creation--and how you measure its success.</li>
<li>Riddle me this: What's the most likely thing someone's going to do after watching a video on YouTube? a) Donate to your nonprofit?; b) Email it to their friend?; or c) Watch another video? Viewers spend almost one hour on YouTube per session. Your best bet for engaging them is programming your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">nonprofit video channel</a> with more related videos.</li>
<li>A good video strategy accounts for planning, production, placement, and tapping into the cultural moment. What gets passed around today may not work as well a year from now. Like all good communications, the messaging in your video has to resonate with the people you are trying to reach--and speak in their language, not yours.</li>
<li>Speaking of culture--your organization's culture is a huge determinant to how successful you might be with video. Is yours a culture of storytelling? Do staff tend to throw around a lot of facts and figures or do they speak about real people and real impact?</li>
<li>Integration is important. Connect your video with your website, campaigns, emails, and other outreach activities. In fact, videos make for great content to share on social media channels like Facebook and Twitter.</li>
<li>Find your passionate people and train them on how to be good storytellers. Like how most fundraisers I know always say 'people give to people'--same idea is true for video. People want to watch charismatic people who are authentic and draw viewers in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Michael Hoffman makes a fine point about the importance of picking passionate people to star in your nonprofit videos. (Photo: Adam Soclof; Captioning provided by StenoKnight CART Services.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What needle is your video trying to move? The content and creative need to work well together to resonate with your audience. Is your video a conversation starter? Does it push viewers to take some sort of action?</li>
<li>Personalizing the story works. There have been lots of great examples from <a href=""http://www.cnnbcvideo.com"" target=""_blank"">MoveOn</a>, <a href=""http://news.cnnbcvideo.com/index2.html?id=&amp;p=&amp;z=&amp;fb="" target=""_blank"">MomsRising</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.see3.net/making-strides-personalized-fundraising-video"" target=""_blank"">American Cancer Society</a> where a person's name can be added into the video content. Expensive, but incredibly effective.</li>
<li>Video should be part of your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. Google often indexes videos on YouTube in the first page of results for some keywords. Also, YouTube is the second biggest search engine on the web.</li>
<li>For those of you who like tracking statistics and monitoring analytics, YouTube now has an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/advertising_insight"" target=""_blank"">Insight program</a> that can help you track conversions, length of views, and more. Have you set up applied for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">YouTube Nonprofit program</a> yet?</li>

Many nonprofits receive as much as <a href=""http://www.afpnet.org/ResourceCenter/ArticleDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=4264"" target=""_blank"">40 percent of their annual donations</a> during the month of December, and we know that early planning is key to making the most of your year-end fundraising season.<br />But where do you actually start? More than almost anything, the strength of your campaign will depend on finding the right year-end story to tell your donors--and then telling it through every channel you've got. But how do you home in on a year-end story that's both rooted in emotion and makes an urgent case for giving? Here are a few questions to get you started:<br /><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you starting your story with a challenge? </strong>Telling your donors all of the amazing things you've already accomplished is great, but it doesn't belong at the beginning of your year-end story. Donors need to know why you need them now, not six months ago. Start your year-end story by telling donors what challenges you'll be able to successfully tackle in 2011 if enough funds are raised now.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are your goals achievable?</strong> The eyes of even the most dedicated conservationist will glaze over if you say next year's goal is to ""solve global warming."" Try ""getting the clean energy bill passed in the Senate"" instead. Focusing on a challenge that donors can wrap their minds around lends credibility--and helps them feel part of a real solution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does your year-end story fit with your organization's story?</strong> Review your organization's mission and founding story. Does your year-end story reflect the emotion and inspiration of that mission? Wrap up your year-end story by making it clear why December's goals are a natural and compelling next step in your organization's path.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br />Once you decide what story will be at the core of your year-end campaign, here are a few more resources to help you feature that story as effectively as possible through your web, email and social media channels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check out the whitepaper ""<a href=""http://www.frogloop.com/care2blog/2010/7/26/2010-overachievers-guide-to-year-end-fundraising.html"" target=""_blank"">The Overachiever's Guide to Year-End Fundraising</a>"" from Sea Change Strategies' Alia McKee Scott and Care2's Eric Rardin. One suggestion we especially liked: Give your friend or family member $10 and ask them to donate through your website. Then watch them try to donate and see if they get confused or lost at any point on your webpage or form. A great way to uncover usability road bumps and improve donor page conversion!</li>

If you haven't, check out the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/OldSpice?v=uLTIowBF0kE&amp;feature=pyv&amp;ad=5174223497&amp;kw=old%20spice&amp;gclid=CLSxkO-Jo6MCFRofswodxneb5A"" target=""_blank"">'I'm on an internet' channel</a> on YouTube before you read this- and get ready for a good laugh.I love these commercials because they're funny, smart, memorable, and undeniably Old Spice. There are lots of ads that make you laugh but are so loosely tied to what they're selling that you'll remember the ad but not the product behind it a day or so later. Entertaining, perhaps. Good for sales? Probably not.Old Spice did a several really smart things with this campaign that any business-including a nonprofit-can learn from.</p>
<ol>
<li>They didn’t ignore their reputation. Old Spice embraced their reputation as an old-school manly cologne/product, and all of the possible clichés that come with it. Then they turned them on their head–making it current, funny and hip. Your organization’s reputation is key to your brand’s success, and it’s hard to control or shape. Why not admit what’s working and what’s not and use it- rather than fight it?</li>
<li>They used humor effectively. Who doesn’t love to laugh? This campaign lets you laugh at andwith it at the same time. It doesn’t victimize anyone or play to the negative (for instance, the obvious “want to get rid of that unpleasant B.O. before your big date? Try Old Spice body wash.”). Nonprofits rarely find a way to inject humor in serious work, and end up talking more about the problems that have to be fixed than celebrating the outcomes by telling those stories with style. You can still be taken seriously and be funny.</li>
<li>They blurred the lines between old and new media. Sure, the ad campaign is broadcast in the typical ways (mostly on your TV). But then the folks at ad agency Weiden + Kennedy (who created this campaign) also set up a hilarious Twitter stream, and used it to encourage people to tweet in questions that the Old Spice guy answered in real time videos on You Tube. It was so effective that celebrities like Apollo Anton Ono, Guy Kawasaki ,&nbsp; and others got involved, and several major media outlets like Fast Company and the New York Times wrote it up. One guy even had the Old Spice guy propose to his girlfriend on his behalf. Instead of trying to do everything (eg use every type of social media) they focused on just one big push involving Twitter and YouTube, which had tremendous reach. Not bad, for a day’s work.</li>
<li>They’re building results while reaching new audiences. According to a recent article in Ad Age, Old Spice is slowly regaining its market share. Nope, the campaign didn’t sell a gazillion bottles of body wash overnight (although I did buy several for guys I know as a gag gift, I confess). Instead, it’s dusted off Old Spice’s reputation and made it cool in the eyes of Millenials, Gen Xers, and other people who would have never considered, or even heard of, the brand before. Nonprofits are always looking for a way to build relationships with younger and new donors. This is a great example of having your generational cake and eating it too.</li>
<li>And they didn’t have to totally rebrand to do it. Sure, they made some changes. But the didn’t change their name or even their (rather cheesy) age-old logo. Instead, they used the freshness of their campaign concept to shift perceptions.</li>
</ol>
<p>What else have you learned from the Old Spice guy? I’d love to know.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1409%1","","","","what-nonprofits-can-learn-old-spice-guy","","","",

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't forget to tell stories - personal stories</strong>. Sharing and storytelling are fundamental to movement-building, because they build trust and empathy.</li>
<li><strong>Individual updates matter less than the overall picture they create</strong>. Sometimes sharing small bits of seemingly inconsequential information is important for movement-building too. The picture they create over time, and the <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2008/09/06/nyt-on-ambient-aware.html"">ambient awareness</a> of your cause that they generate, helps build empathy and stronger relationships in your community.</li>
<li><strong>Change doesn't happen on its own - you have to participate if you want to see social media succeed at movement-building. </strong>While nonprofits should always think carefully and strategically before getting involved in social media, it's still true that the potential of social media to bring about change will go untapped unless people who care join in.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>The internet is not an ATM. </strong>A great reminder - social media is best for cultivating and engaging your audiences, not necessarily raising money directly.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Don't let your interns manage your social media... but do let them help educate you. </strong>If your interns manage your social media, what happens when they leave? All of their knowledge leaves with them, and you're left in a tricky situation. A better way to get interns involved in social media might be to use them as peer educators, to coach staff through using social media on their own.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate to management why social media is relevant by showing them what peers and competitors are doing. </strong>If your management team is resisting getting into social media personally, show them what their peers, friends, or rivals are doing already. <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Great stuff, I think you'll agree. If you were there and have insights I missed, share them in the comments!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1412%1","","","","social-media-organizing-nonprofits","","","",

I'll order it today. His talk emphasized the challenges of working in a sector that plays by different rules than for-profit companies do. In particular, he waxed poetic about the disadvantages of paying nonprofit leaders less than their for-profit counterparts, our obsessive focus on keeping overhead costs low, and the lack of risk-taking. While his ideas might seem controversial to some, it was clearly music to the ears of the fundraisers in this crowd.<br /><br />I often think that the nonprofit sector's resistance to branding, or perhaps investing in effective communications in general, is penny-wise and pound foolish. After all, branding is the way you build an effective platform for communicating about your mission. It's the foundation of the house- a critical starting point. Why start campaigning, eg, raising money for a new roof, when the fundamental structure is flawed?<br /><br />Kim Klein's new book, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reliable-Fundraising-Unreliable-Times-Survive/dp/0470479507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282678164&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Reliable Fundraising in Unreliable Times</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reliable-Fundraising-Unreliable-Times-Survive/dp/0470479507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282678164&amp;sr=8-1""></a>"" raises of few of the same points Pallotta discussed. In particular, Klein worries that an organization that won't invest in comfortable office space, appropriately paid staff, or other fundamental tools necessary to run a business essentially hamstring themselves.<br /><br />While I wish Pallotta had spent a bit more time talking about solutions and less time preaching to the converted, I'm with him. And if you work in a nonprofit where you're trying to convince leadership that investing in your own capacity is a good idea (regardless of how it impacts the percentage of your costs that go to overhead versus programs), I suggest you check these two books out.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1066%1","","","","uncharitable-dan-pallotta-dma-nonprofit-conference","capacity Brandraising","capacity Brandraising","",

It's a simple question that will help you stand out during the busy year-end appeal season:</p>","<p>Here at Big Duck we start thinking about year-end appeals in the middle of summer. (We're weird like that.)</p>
<p>It's a giant topic. People write entire books on it. Since you don't have time for that now, we're going to share just one useful thing with you. It's a simple question that will help you stand out during the busy year-end appeal season:</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>This valuable question can serve as a roadmap. So, to answer the question ""Who cares?"", what do you need to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your audience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get their attention and convince them that your cause is important.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do it quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Getting attention with copy means short, compelling prose. It means email subject lines that inspire the recipient to click; direct mail that entices with a stellar headline (or envelope teaser); copy that crackles and pops off the page or screen with more excitement than the electric boogaloo.</p>
<p>This is all easier said than done, of course. So let's go back to the original question: Who cares?<br />Well, start with yourself. You care about the issues your nonprofit addresses, right?</p>
<p>Okay, then. Why do you care? Free associate. List all of the reasons. Keep free-associating until you get to the heart of it. Some of your answers will be logical, some emotional, some academic, and some downright visceral. Write down everything that comes to mind, even reasons that may seem ridiculous or bad. There are no bad ideas in a brainstorm. Spend at least 30 minutes free-associating about why you care.</p>
<p>Set your list aside for at least an hour. If you have time to leave it for a day, even better. The important thing is that you come back to it fresh.</p>
<p>What stands out? What is immediately compelling? There's your hook.</p>
<p>Once you have your hook, don't overwhelm your readers with information. Maybe there's one anecdote that embodies your hook. Perhaps there's one compelling statistic that will bring it all home.<br />Whatever it is you write to support your hook, be sure to keep it short. Donors are busy people--never more so than during the holidays, when they also happen to be receiving year-end appeals from every other organization they've ever been in touch with.</p>
<p>Your goal is to inspire them to write you a check or make an online donation. Taking a step back and reminding yourself why you care will take you a long way toward convincing your audiences why they should care too.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1409%1,1413%2,1067%3,1416%4","","","","one-simple-tip-writing-your-year-end-appeal","year-end-appeals messaging fundraising duck-pond copywriting","year-end-appeals messaging fundraising duck-pond copywriting","",

<p>I admit it: the first websites that Big Duck built for nonprofits in the 1990s were definitely brochureware. After all, Al Gore had just invented the internet, Jeff Bezos was busy figuring out interactivity at his fledging company Amazon, and nobody went near a computer with a credit card if they knew what was good for them... it was a different time with a different agenda.</p>
<p>'Online' is no longer synomymous with 'your website'. Today's internet comes in four complex flavors: <em>earned</em>, <em>owned</em>, <em>paid</em> and <em>social</em> media.</p>
<p><strong>Earned</strong>: This is coverage your organization earns from others online. Back in the day, earned media was what a good publicist secured for you- and it generally meant getting on the radio, in the paper, or on TV. Earned media today may mean being featured in a blog, linked to, mentioned on a peer's website, and more. Earned media is important online because it boosts your organization's credibility to be recognized by a respectable third party (let's hope they're respectable!), and good links and references can dramatically improve your search engine rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Owned</strong>: This is the stuff your organization builds- chiefly your website and any microsites, vanity sites or community sites you've developed. Most people turn to the web first when they need up-to-date, relevant information and expect your organization to be ready to deliver it when they visit you. (Yes, that means it's bad to refer to last July's gala as an 'upcoming event' on your homepage.)</p>
<p><strong>Paid</strong>: This basically means advertising. Some organizations pay for ads online as part of social marketing campaigns (for instance, an ad encouraging drivers to wear seatbelts on a car sales website, or promoting condom use on a dating website). Many organizations are finding that social networks like Facebook allow you to target your ads to very specific types of people. Some are experimenting with Facebook and other social network ads as a way to recruit people into programs ('become a teacher!'), take action ('stop corporate polluters!') and even solicit gifts. For most organizations, advertising online is a much easier way to target specific audiences cost-effectively, but is often still overlooked as a line-item in the communications budget.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong>: Some people are still questioning the value of social media (please let me know who they are so I can chat with them, ok?). Whether you value it or not, it's hard to argue that social networks, blogs, Twitter, and other social platforms have transformed the way most people now communicate. For most nonprofits, using social media well means being clear how it will impact your organization's relationships. Are you building the love with your donors, activists, peers or potential staff in that Facebook group or Twitter stream? What offline actions are you hoping will emerge from your efforts?<br />Whether you love or hate the highly interactive, fast-changing state of the web today, you've got to agree that the old approach is no longer likely to work. With that in mind, perhaps it's time to reconsider how you budget and staff for it?</p>
<p>Take a look at the big organizations. They've got entire online departments with dedicated staff for social media channels, blog editors, and more. While that may be rare, it's worth noting as a sign of the future. Perhaps it's time your organization correlate its online communications with the staff who are responsible for all that great, important communicating?</p>
<p>Keep me posted here! I want to know what's working, in particular, for smaller and mid-size organizations.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2061%1","","","","four-flavors-online","website staffing online","website staffing online","",

Designers design for other designers. We tend to make decisions that only other people who do what we do will notice or appreciate.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a sign of age, but I find that, the longer I write for different audiences, the less I care about pleasing the writers out there. With the exception of a few grammarians, your participants, advocates, and donors don't care one iota that I just used a serial (a.k.a. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma"" target=""_blank"">Oxford</a>) comma in that list of three. But I did. Because I like serial commas. I also just wrote a fragment. On purpose. There's another one.</p>
<p>Grammar exists because, most of the time, it helps to clarify your meaning. Missing punctuation or misplaced modifiers can have disastrous results. There's a ""grammar saves lives"" group on Facebook that uses, ""Let's eat Grandpa vs. Let's eat, Grandpa"" as its prime example.</p>
<p>So yes, the rules of grammar exist to help you say what you mean without cannibalizing Grandpa.<br />Here's the thing, though: it's better to be clear than right.</p>
<p>First of all, being right when it comes to grammar is often debatable. Style guides disagree with each other. Rules that were drilled into tiny heads in middle school and high school turn out to be wrong (to occasionally split an infinitive breaks no official rule, as it turns out).</p>
<p>Plus, language and grammar rules evolve. One rule that's becoming much more accepted is using a plural pronoun even if your antecedent is singular. English has no neuter pronoun, which can often lead to the awkward use of <em>he or she</em> or <em>she or he</em> or, worse yet, an exclusive <em>he</em> to represent both <em>he </em>and<em> she</em>. Believe it or not, grammarian nonprofiteers, some style guides have begun to recommend using <em>they</em>. An example: A doctor should take a vacation every year so that they don't burn out.</p>
<p>The traditionalist in me would write around that sentence to make it <em>doctors</em>, plural, because it's still difficult for me to break the ""rule,"" especially when I know that there are purists out there who will assume it's wrong and judge me to be a terrible writer and therefore a terrible person.<br />I'd like to think I'm not a terrible person.</p>
<p>Strictly following--or not following--the rules of grammar might also be a ""personality"" decision. If you've taken the time to define your organization's personality (you have, right?), whatever you write should be in the tone of that personality. If <em>bold</em> is one of your personality traits, maybe a hard-hitting fragment is just what your copy needs at one particular moment. On the other hand, if <em>intellectual</em> is one of your personality traits, being sticklers for all things <em>AP Stylebook</em>, <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>, or Strunk &amp; White may be a better way to go.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the important thing is that people understand you. Usually, proper grammar helps you write more clearly and, in general, I strongly recommend that you write well and correctly.<br />But hey, if the best way to be clear is to break a grammatical rule, go for it. You need to reach your audiences. Especially in this economy. And there's another fragment.</p>
<p>If someone points out that what you've written is grammatically incorrect, take a look at it again. When you correct the grammar, is it still clear (and on personality)? If so, write it correctly. But if being wrong is indeed clearer and more effective, why should you be right?</p>
<p>Err on the side of clarity, nonprofiteers. I give you permission to be grammatically wrong if you have to be. And I write for a living, so feel free to blame me if you want to.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1408%1,1416%2","Blog | Clarity vs Grammar","","","sweet-clarity","storytelling personality grammar copywriting audience","storytelling personality grammar copywriting audience","",

<p>After one of my talks, I hung around to hear a panel discussion about earned versus paid media. I was curious: how many of these smaller, local nonprofits are really buying advertising? Or even paying a PR firm a retainer to get them ink?</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but where I live (New York City, baby!) the traditional advertising and PR industries have both been turned upside down and shaken by social media. It seems that those professionals who've understood and embraced it (like Weiden + Kennedy, <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/what-nonprofits-can-learn-old-spice-guy"" target=""_blank"">Old Spice's ad agency</a>) are hanging in, but those that don't are closing their doors daily.</p>
<p>Very few, if any, of the nonprofits we work with here at Big Duck regularly spend money on advertising. Some have a PR budget, but most of those organizations increasingly doubt the ROI.<br />I suspect general marketing (e.g. reaching the broad public- as opposed to direct marketing, which targets individuals) just doesn't pay off directly enough to warrant the ongoing expense- unless you're publicizing events (for instance, a show at a theater). Even organizations that used to advertise in order to change public perception around an issue (called social marketing) seem to do so less and less.</p>
<p>Does your organization advertise? Or retain a PR firm to help you get media coverage? I'd love to hear more about why, where, and what the results are. Please share your comments here- or email me privately if you prefer at Sarah (at) bigducknyc (dot) com.

And if they're online projects or campaigns, they're often hastily conceived, designed, written, and launched.</p>","<p>At most nonprofits, new campaigns or communications projects usually start with a flurry of activity. And if they're online projects or campaigns, they're often hastily conceived, designed, written, and launched.</p>
<p>To get things moving fast, copy is written and designs are developed on the fly, often with little or no strategy behind them--sometimes using ideas, colors, or even logos that the organization itself doesn't use. Staff members will spend all their time getting these campaigns up and running and then watering them, like seedlings, as they bloom into full-blown advocacy, outreach, or fundraising projects in a matter of weeks. To work the gardening metaphor even harder, it's almost like the nonprofit is a peach tree bearing fruit that looks more like oranges and lemons: only vaguely related, if at all.</p>
<p>Over time, these special projects can start to wither. Staff time to devote to them gets limited as new initiatives get underway, or the community grows so large it requires more time to manage (who'll be the mayor of the lemons?). It might get difficult to respond in real time to all the conversations that unfold. Because the project started up so fast, it may even lack a clear objective, or ways to measure results. Organizations find themselves understaffed to manage the multiple websites, Twitter streams, Facebook pages, etc., so the relationships these initiatives sparked get neglected.</p>
<p>So how can we launch innovative campaigns that use all of this rocking technology to advance our missions and build relationships without driving ourselves stark, raving mad and confusing the people we connect with?</p>
<!--break-->
<p><strong> </strong><strong>What's a poor nonprofit to do?</strong></p>
<p>Here at Big Duck we're big believers in two tried-and-true marketing concepts: <em>positioning</em> and <em>personality</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Positioning</em> is the big idea we want to establish in the minds of our target audiences.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Personality</em> is the tone and style we use to communicate.</p>
<p>When we help organizations shift their communications, we often start by establishing clear organizational positioning and personality, regardless of whether it's a branding project, website, campaign, etc. That's because it's critical to have some way to weave together all communications. And that big idea has to emerge from a nonprofit's vision and mission above all else.</p>
<p>For example, let's say the Lead Pencil Association of America (names changed to protect the innocent) launches a revolutionary ""Lead the way"" campaign to get folks to throw out pens and go back to the classic yellow #2 pencils. They use a special look and feel (yellow with pink and grey, perhaps), Facebook page, Twitter hashtag and background design, and so forth, and it's very different from the organization's typical blue and black, rather serious branding. You can bet that the organization's leadership wants to capture the 10,000 people who are connected to the project and be sure they know who's behind the campaign. Even more so, they want to convert them to donors or advocates for future Lead Pencil Association work. But with the media and the messaging so disconnected, that's going to be a seriously uphill battle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a well-defined brand like Apple computers makes sure that every campaign they launch ties back to their core positioning and personality. Remember the ""<a href=""http://www.icouple.sg/blog/tech/893"">Think different</a>"" campaign featuring Ghandi and Einstein? Or the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac"">I'm a Mac/I'm a PC</a>"" commercials of the past few years? Both campaigns are different conceptually, but they're united by a common underlying strategy about how Apple wants to be perceived. Someone who participates in a social media action as part of the ""Think Different"" campaign can't help but know that it's an initiative of Apple computers, right?</p>
<p><strong>Let's grow peaches</strong>.</p>
<p>What we love about <em>positioning</em> and <em>personality</em> is that they're actually time- and cost-saving tools any nonprofit can use. Sure, it's work to figure out what they should be for your organization and build buy-in. But once your organization's positioning and personality are completed and approved, it becomes so much easier and faster to grow peaches.</p>
<p>When each initiative you launch clearly links back to the ""mother brand"" of the organization, you're building a much more cohesive and valuable community, no matter what technology you're using.Want more about how to do it?

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm stunned by how much email I get these days. Sure, social media is hard to make time for, but I find my collective personal and professional blogging, Tweeting, and Facebooking still only amounts to a fraction of the time I spend emailing. So I decided a few weeks ago to ruthlessly deal with email differently in the hopes of wrangling this vicious time-sucking beast to the ground.</p>
<p>First, I stopped the 'autocheck' feature in my email application. Instead of being distracted by the constant lure of new email in my inbox, I now manually get email, so it's a deliberate act requiring premeditation. On top of that, I'm limiting how many times a day I read and respond to email instead of giving in to the urge to check it compulsively before, after and sometimes even during meetings or calls.</p>
<p>Curious how many hours a day you spend emailing? Just install the free version of <a href=""http://www.rescuetime.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rescue Time</a> on your Mac or PC and it'll tell you. Prepare to be shocked. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that you spend twice as much time managing your email every day than you think you do.</p>
<p>I've long been a fan of maintaining a tidy inbox. Folks like Merlin Mann will also tell you in his<a href=""http://inboxzero.com/"" target=""_blank""> Inbox Zero work</a> how a cluttered inbox = a cluttered mind. But keeping my inbox empty or, at least, light, means triaging the content of emails into tasks, events and to dos (all managed with other software, of course). It also means ruthlessly filing with folders and sub-folders. I spend time doing this daily- another time-suck- but worth it to maintain sanity, I find.</p>
<p>I've also been on an unsubscribing rampage- more on that in another upcoming blog entry soon.</p>

<p><em>(This post was originally published 10/28/2010 and has been updated for today's nonprofit world.)</em><br /><br />With 2014 knocking at the door, I suspect some of you are already sharpening your pencils, or perhaps dusting off your keyboards, getting ready to write an RFP for the big project you're hoping to tackle soon.&nbsp;Writing an RFP can be a bit like telling the doctor what medicine you need when you're sick: it requires a certain amount of self-diagnosis. In particular, this process also asks you to figure out how long the cure should take and what it should cost. And, much like what you expect from a doctor, the real-life answers to those questions are often very different than what you'd expect.</p>
<p>Nonprofits send us Ducks dozens of RFPs each year for communications projects like rebrands, websites, online fundraising, and more, and we've seen it all. Here are three tips we hope will help you write better RFPs in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Set a realistic budget and timeline based on other nonprofit's projects.</strong> Most organizations set budgets and timelines for work based on variables other than experience managing similar projects. Often, the timeline to complete a project is linked to an event, fiscal year, or other variable that's not necessarily connected to how long projects like these typically take.</p>
<p>Similarly, the budget is set based on what the board thinks should be spent, or what's affordable, rather than what doing the job right will cost. If you're thinking about redoing your website (or other communications tool) reach out to the communications staff of organizations who have websites you admire and ask them what they spent, how long it took, and what the experience was like. Ask about the team they worked with and assess if you'd need a similar level of resources. Find out what kind of staff time was required to get the project done and think about your own ability to make that time.</p>
<p>Talking with peers will not only give you a realistic sense of what a project like yours might cost (both in terms of budget and time), it'll generate a list of firms who's work you know you like and might want to contact. If you've underbudgeted or been unrealistic about timing, it'll also give you information you need to push back internally and avoid working with dissappointing vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Let the consultants be the doctors.</strong> Rather than going in to detail about all the deliverables you imagine you could need, consider outlining the challenge you're facing and let the people you send the RFP to suggest a solution. It'll save you time writing the RFP, and you might get a better result in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Go for process and experience over flash.</strong> If you were taking out your appendix, you'd probably want to hire a surgeon who'd done thousands of comparable surgeries and could talk you through their process in detail, right? More experienced consultants and agencies typically respond to RFPs with how they would manage the <em>process</em> rather than with creative ideas.&nbsp; They don't presume to know the solution to your problem until they've been engaged and started doing the necessary homework to get to know you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, many of the best (including Big Duck) have policies against doing <a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/"" target=""_blank"">spec work</a>.&nbsp; Don't be dazzled by a creative response full of flash; look for a substantive process and a team you feel confident will get you results based on their track record and your needs.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2061%1,1066%2,1405%3","How to write a good nonprofit RFP","","","crafting better request for proposal","process rebranding RFP website skills expert tips","online skills expert tips RFP process rebranding website","",

My favorite comment was one of her first, ""Some times changing the situation can be easier than changing people's behaviors.""</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Here are some of ways you can change the situation at your organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blog.techsoup.org/node/363"" target=""_blank"">Check and update the power management settings</a> (sleep, hibernating, etc) on everyone's computers. This can save $60/computer every year. Anna's specific recommendations: Set your monitor to power off after 5 minutes, your hard drive to power off after 10 minutes, and your computer to go to 'sleep' after 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Green your operations. Cut down on travel, consume less energy, and stop storing so much data. (Guilty confession: I'm an email hoarder.)</li>
<li>Save toner and money with programs like <a href=""http://www.ecofont.com/en/products/green/font/download-the-ink-saving-font.html"" target=""new"">Ecofont</a>, a more eco-friendly font that uses less ink (actually, tiny white dots) when you print.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Waste less paper and reduce toner usage. Print double-sided, in draft mode with 0.7"" margins. <a href=""http://blog.techsoup.org/node/575"" target=""new"">You can also install GreenPrint or FinePrint </a>to eliminate wasted page prints.</li>
<li>Don't trust Energystar alone (it is not audited). <a href=""http://www.epeat.net/"" target=""new"">Check Epeat</a> for bronze, silver and gold ratings of energy efficient equipment.</li>
<li>Embrace the cloud. Cloud computing lets you maximize server use and keep older computers longer. You probably already use some popular cloud software as a service (SaaS) such as Salesforce, Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter, and Basecamp. TechSoup has a <a href=""http://bit.ly/9G5u5d"" target=""new"">great webinar on why you should care about cloud computing</a>. Watch, listen, learn and share.</li>

It's one of Brooklyn's most populated neighborhoods: home to liberals, strollers, foodies, and much more. On the weekends, I often take some time to stroll around, run some errands, and catch up with friends over brunch.As a communications strategist and fundraiser, I'm always on the look out for interesting campaigns, appeals, and tactics. Oh, and apparently I've got that face. The one that says, hey, ask her for money--she'll buy that candy bar from the kid on the subway. I've got that mouth too, often doing most of the talking when a telemarketer calls for a donation, shocked that I haven't immediately hung up.<a href=""http:..www.plannedparenthood.org""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3209"" title=""Donation request"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/IMG_9002-225x300.jpg"" alt=""A lovely fundraising activist for Planned Parenthood"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a></p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that a young activist would think to ask me, of all the passersby on busy 7th Avenue last Sunday, if I cared about women's rights. Well of course I do, so I stopped to engage in what quickly became an appeal for my support. A paid fundraiser for <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org"" target=""new"">Planned Parenthood</a> (this came up later), Mary, started by asking if I'd make a donation of $30/month for the next year. This blew me away. Maybe I give less than the average do-gooder in my community, but she could see my shock and quickly recovered. Within minutes, I was filling out the paperwork to make a more modest, one-time gift of $25.00.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><span id=""more-3199""> </span>I'm a long-time supporter of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, so I'm an easy sell (In fact, I used to manage their telefundraising program in the late 1990s as a consultant with <a href=""http://www.ahadirect.com/"" target=""blank"">Adams Hussey &amp; Associates</a>). I may have even been her first donor and she happily answered my questions about how and why she got involved (via college campus recruitment).The whole exchange left me with a few questions for you, my nonprofit friends, as you try to raise more money (often unrestricted) from good people like me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you know your army of fundraisers? </strong>You may not have volunteers and activists canvassing the streets on your behalf, but I'm guessing you've got some passionate donors. Chances are they tell their friends about you, talk you up at dinner parties, and may even ask friends to donate around year-end or birthday wish time.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have a brief and compelling case for giving? </strong>Chances are if you and your army of fundraisers could fit it into a 140-character tweet that others would want to copy and retweet, you are in good shape.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have a second or third ask in the wings?</strong> Most prospects don't give the first time you ask. Are you ready with a new ask and reason to support you before letting them walk away?</li>
<li><strong>Do you cultivate the donor beyond the gift?</strong> I haven't received an email or letter thanking me for the donation I made last Sunday. It was pretty recent, so I'm sure it is on its way. And what about you? Do you thank your donors? And when you do, what comes next?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but you've got work to do. But before you go back to raising millions, share some thoughts and pearls of wisdom here.

For instance, as little as a year or so ago, the topic of how a nonprofit might use Facebook sparked a lot of debate and resistance. <em>Do we really even need it? What's the value? Who'll manage it?</em></p>","<p>Things move so fast these days it's possible to see perspectives change radically on an issue in a short period of time. For instance, as little as a year or so ago, the topic of how a nonprofit might use Facebook sparked a lot of debate and resistance. <em>Do we really even need it? What's the value? Who'll manage it?</em> But these days, it's more common to hear Facebook discussed as a 'given' in a nonprofit's online communications landscape.</p>
<p>Blogging's like that, too. Until fairly recently, the nonprofits we work with here at <a href=""http://bigducknyc.com/"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck</a><a href=""#_msocom_1""></a> and speak with were more likely to not have, or even want, a blog. It wasn't that they didn't have the time- it was that they didn't see the value. Now, more and more organizations understand that blogging provides a fluid way to break down some of the walls that separate you from your clients, donors, peers, and other constituents. Not only can you share a broader range of content with them more fluidly, you can do it faster, more responsively, and engage others in online discussion about the topics. Great stuff!</p>
<p>This adoption of blogging has got me wondering: will the nonprofit newsletter go the way of the annual report? That is to say, could blogging replace the need for an organization to produce a more formal document that gets printed or emailed? I'm thinking yes.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><a href=""http://redcrosspdx.blogspot.com/2010/11/all-aboard-ss-huckleberry.html""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3271"" title=""Cross Blog_ Award-winning Red Cross news and views from Oregon and beyond_ All Aboard The SS Huckleberry!"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/Cross-Blog_-Award-winning-Red-Cross-news-and-views-from-Oregon-and-beyond_-All-Aboard-The-SS-Huckleberry-300x207.jpg"" alt=""Red Cross Oregon Blog"" width=""300"" height=""207"" /></a></p>
<p>For now, it's possible that your donors (and perhaps others) still want to get something in print- or perhaps don't want to hear from you all that much. It's also possible your organization doesn't have the resources to maintain a blog. After all, blogging is a bit like having an energetic dog: you've got to feed it, walk it, exercise it, and help it connect with others for it to thrive. But that's likely to change as generations change and RSS feeds increasing become mandatory ways we stay connected and informed.</p>
<p>Blogging requires strong writing skills, discipline, and project management skills. Sure, newsletters do, too- but newsletter readers are generally more forgiving of a publication that's got some dull content every now and again. They're also less likely to write and tell you that your newsletter's dull.</p>
<p>For a great nonprofit blog example, I'm partial to the <a href=""http://redcrosspdx.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Trail Chapter's Cross Blog</a>. These savvy bloggers mix engaging stories about disaster relief, donors, social media and more with humor and brevity- and just keep cranking it out. I know nothing about this chapter and never visit the area, but I follow this blog. Imagine how I'd feel if I were a donor?</p>
<p>If you agree that your newsletter may be aging out and blogging is coming up, here are a few tips to consider as you look ahead to your organization's blogging future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't feel one person has to do all the writing. Mixing it up (the way we do here in the Duck Call, Big Duck's blog), takes the pressure off any one person and adds a nice range of voices and texture.</li>
<li>Worried you can't sustain it? Try blogging offline for 3 months first before you launch. Your 'dummy' blog will give you a chance to practice blogging without the shame of public failure. It'll also generate a lot of good content you can use to fill in the real thing later on.</li>
<li>Be clear what the purpose of your blog is, who should read and comment on it, and stay focused. Your blog should support your mission and engage people toward some good end.

But peanut butter is a sticking point. Creamy or crunchy? All-natural or processed to the brink? Just about every member of our team has a distinct and deep-seated opinion on the subject. So in celebration of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/11/november-is-peanut-butter-lovers-month.html"" target=""_blank"">National Peanut Butter Lovers' Month</a>&nbsp;we decided to nut up and throw down with the First Annual Big Duck Peanut Butter Taste-off.</p>
<p>We each contributed a jar of our favorite variety to compete in a blind taste test. (The ever fair-and-balanced&nbsp;<a href=""/about/team/elizabeth_ricca"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth</a>&nbsp;acted as facilitator--the only one to know the true identity of each entry.) Our peanutty contenders ranged from grocery store brands to local and organic varieties with one homemade spread (Sarah's Magic Nut Glory, recipe below) thrown in the mix. Each duck was sure theirs would come out on top.&nbsp;</p>
<!--break--><!--break-->
<p>Over the course of a lunch hour, we gorged on the gooey stuff. We slathered it on celery, heaped it on challah, relished it on a Ritz. And then came the scoring. Tasters gave each peanut butter points for texture, taste, appearance, and an overall rating. The verdict? Choosy Ducks choose...Jif. Well, sort of. The numbers place Peanut Butter &amp; Co.'s Crunch Time, Smuckers Natural, and Sarah's custom concoction at the top as well. But in an office where most of us prefer the farmer's market to the supermarket, Jif's high marks were the big surprise. The full results appear below along with additional peanut butter insights and revelations. You can also check out our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=251363&amp;id=161192451835&amp;ref=mf"" target=""_blank"">taste-off photos</a> on Facebook. Got a favorite peanut butter? Comment and let us know; it just may be featured in the second annual competition. As for us, we're already starting to make plans for National Cookie Day next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sarah's Magic Nut Glory</strong></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>- a few cups dry roasted unsalted organic peanuts<br />- some groovy organic sunflower oil (I like Hain's)<br />- honey from local bees (they are nicer and better for your immune system)<br />- kosher salt (I'm crazy about the stuff)</p>
<p>My approach to cooking is more like crafting, so this recipe involves a fair amount of room for personal interpretation. Make it your own and let me know how it comes out! In a blender, blend as many peanuts as you can stand. For smoother peanut butter blend longer. Make a lot of noise and have fun. Transfer ground peanuts to a bowl and drizzle in oil one tablespoon at a time as you stir until the consistency seems about right. Fold in honey and salt to taste. Pop it in a jar and refrigerate. I'm not sure how long this stuff will last before botulism sets in- so I suggest chucking it in a week or two if uneaten, just to be safe. Variations: add cinnamon or cardamom powder in small amounts, and chocolate chips would be yummy too. Enjoy on a nice piece of grainy bread with sliced bananas on top.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1,1408%2","","","","ducks-go-nuts","fun office peanut-butter team-building food-challenge team-building peanut-butter office fun","","",

In this post, Maddie and Lindy answer a few questions for our readers.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href=""http://www.socialfish.org/open-community/talkers-toolkit""><img title=""Open Community Book Tour"" src=""http://www.socialfish.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/OC_badge_booktour.png"" alt=""Open Community Book Tour"" width=""125"" height=""125"" /></a></strong></strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe <em>Open Community</em> in 140 characters or less?</strong><br />Love it! ""A practical 'little book of big ideas' for organizations interested in how to find, nurture and grow their community online.""<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did you write your book, <em>Open Community</em>?</strong><br />We come from the association industry and for many of us ""membership"" people, community is old hat. It's what we do. It's central to our work. And yet, for some reason (actually a lot of reasons) what we know about community isn't always translating well to building community online. We have talked to thousands of association executives who have voiced their frustrations about the social web--from the overabundance of tools and the disorderly experimentation of staff and members, to the lack of organizational support and the unwieldy processes for monitoring and managing social media, and that's just the beginning. It's easy to get bogged down in the newness and the detail, and miss the bigger picture--not the 10,000-foot bigger picture, but the ""just high enough to make practical sense"" bigger picture.<br />So we started writing the book, and the idea that kept popping up is the concept of <em>Open Community</em>. Here's the gist. Your Open Community is your people who are bonded by what your organization represents and care enough to talk to each other (hopefully about you!) online.</p>
<p><strong>Is this book just for people who work in associations? Who else should read it?</strong><br />The book is written specifically for people who work in membership organizations, simply because that is the industry we come from, but there are many organizations and for-profit companies that have a ""membership"" model that will find the ideas in the book extremely useful. Members are basically stakeholders - as are volunteers, donors, evangelists, <a href=""http://www.fiskateers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fiskateers</a>, Ambassadors, any number of other groups of people invested in an organization - and we'd love to test our ideas on all kinds of organizations.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You describe this book as a 'conversation starter'. Where should people go to continue the conversation?</strong><br />We have a book website at <a href=""http://www.socialfish.org/open-community"" target=""_blank"">www.opencommunitybook.com</a>. We'll be posting lots of ideas from the book for deeper discussion on our blog and aggregating all the case studies we find here. We encourage anyone to <a href=""http://www.socialfish.org/contact"" target=""_blank"">contact us</a> with any stories of how you are nurturing your open communities, if you'd like to be showcased as a case study. For more open-ended or informal questions and comments, we also have an <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/opencommunity"" target=""_blank"">Open Community Facebook page</a> and definitely welcome feedback there too.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the chapters of your book is dedicated to developing a ""social organization"". How is that concept the same or different to what Beth Kanter's and Allison Fine's concept of a ""networked nonprofit""?</strong><br />Actually our concept of a social organization is very similar to that of a <a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/the-networked-nonprofit/"" target=""_blank"">networked nonprofit</a> (we're in full agreement with Beth and Allison!) but we approached the idea from the inside out as opposed to the outside in. Beth and Allison describe the networked nonprofit as being like a social network interlinked other networks as well as free agents (individuals); with particular qualities that make up its social culture (transparency, relationship-building, etc.). When we talk about the social organization, we start with exploring individual behaviors and skill sets, then internal processes such as community management, establishing good social media policies, the role of staff in building relationships online... and then we look at cultural issues of openness, collaboration, decentralization. Both books go very well together, actually, and Beth was kind enough to review an early version of <em>Open Community</em> for us while we were editing it!<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Many nonprofits struggle with deciding where to build their online community, say on an existing platform like Facebook or on a customizable platform like Ning. Any advice for those in that position?</strong><br />Absolutely. <em>Open Community</em> (the book) is all about how to find your open community (your people). We describe how an open community exists in all kinds of places around an organization - the ecosystem - and the decision of where to build your own will depend entirely on where your stakeholders are already hanging out online and what their needs might be. Most importantly, we make the distinction between a homebase (your own official space or spaces) and outposts (public spaces like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) and how they relate to each other and happily coexist.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In workshops and webinars on social media, participants almost always ask me about staffing? About how much time do you think it takes to build an online community?</strong><br />It takes as much time as you will give it - and the more you can give it, the better, especially in the very beginning when it will need a LOT of tending and watering (so to speak). We run our own community (Young Association Professionals at <a href=""http://yapstar.org/"" target=""_blank"">yapstar.org</a>) and we started it with 10 friends on Facebook; it's grown to over 1,100 members in three years. There are times when building a community is a full time job; there are other times when it will percolate along nicely without you having to do much at all. The key is to make it awesome enough so that you have champions within the community who can eventually help you with some of the time consuming stuff. Building community is an art, more than a science, and every group will be different. The book contains a lot of ideas that should help, though!<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the most unexpected reaction you have received to your book so far?</strong><br />Well, this is our first book, so technically we had no idea what to expect! But we have received some amazing feedback so far and it's only been out for two weeks. We went against the grain, though, by designing the book to be small enough to carry around all day, short enough to read on an airplane, and completely devoid of case studies, because we wanted everyone to immediately start thinking about how the ideas might apply to their own organization... and so far we have had several comments saying the book is ""meaty from the very first page"". Which is awesome!<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the #1 thing you hope readers take away from <em>Open Community</em>?</strong><br />That your open community is already out there online - you just need to find your people where they already are, and start getting to know them and they will help you flourish.</p>

<p><br />Let's face it--working in a nonprofit can be draining. Employees take on multiple roles and work long hours for the love of the cause. So sometimes, we can all use a break. To get out of the office a few times a year, the North American staff of Masa Israel Journey takes what we like to call a ""Yom Kef"" (that's Hebrew for ""staff day""--or better, ""fun day!"").</p>
<p><br />During our days out of the office, we always learn new things about each other and find commonalities that we probably never would have discovered over our cubicle walls. <a href=""http://www.themasaisraelblog.org/2010/11/10/photo-essay-masa-israel-north-america-yom-kef/"" target=""_blank"">This time, we decided to go hiking on Bear Mountain.</a> After rescheduling three or four times (coordinating eight people's schedules is a challenge in itself), we finally tied our sneakers, packed our water bottles, and piled into two Zipcars to head out of the city. It was a beautiful day, the foliage was at its peak, and the company was good as we set out on the trail.</p>
<p>Only, we got lost.</p>
<p>That's not to say we didn't have a blast; but we did learn a few lessons that will definitely serve us back in the office:</p>
<p><br /><strong>Lesson 1: Always take (or make) a map.</strong><strong> </strong>We reached the trail just fine, hiked to the top of the mountain, and then started to head down...only to realize we had no idea where we were going. We knew we were on a trail from the markings on the trees--it just wasn't the right trail. When planning projects for Masa Israel, we often have great ideas and want to start working on them as soon as possible, but we don't give ourselves enough time to plan effective follow-through. Now, we try to write up our tactics and strategies for new campaigns in advance and get input before we jump the gun.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Lesson 2: Listen to management, but don't be afraid to speak up.</strong> Our director knew exactly where we were going as we scaled the trail to the peak. But an hour after we started our descent, we were all fairly sure we were headed the wrong direction. He was so certain he knew the way down, though, that nobody else was able to take charge and reevaluate our position until we were several miles out of the way. Our office is a young one; all of us are in our 20's and 30's, and we all are passionate about what we do--the challenge is making sure the people who have been around longer are open to new ideas. We try to make our office open to constructive criticism from all sides to keep everyone on their toes, but sometimes change takes a little longer than we hope.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Recognize when it's time to ask for help.</strong> When we finally came to the consensus that we were on the wrong side of the mountain, we had a choice: keep walking and eventually get back to our cars, or have two people try to hitch a ride and bring the cars back to pick up the rest of us. Luckily, we chose the latter--a friendly motorist stopped as soon as we pointed our thumbs skyward, and two of us jumped in while the rest waited on the side of the road. Ten minutes later, our cars arrived--but we found out that if we had continued walking, it would have taken us three or four hours to get back. In this case, asking for help ended up saving us a significant amount of time and effort in getting to our final destination. So it often is in the office; sometimes we convince ourselves that we can get things done on our own and by our bootstraps when the best idea is usually to bring in some outside help to point us in the right direction on the most direct path.</p>
<p>And so, without any awkward or cliché office bonding games, we bonded nonetheless by getting lost but working through our predicament together, scaling the both literal and metaphorical mountains.</p>
<p>After the hike, we went to dinner at a Bukharian restaurant in Brooklyn. The lesson there? Let someone who speaks Russian order for you (luckily our director did the Peace Corps in Kyrgyzstan). And don’t ask any questions. Nazdarovya (cheers)!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","getting-lost-way-bonding","teamwork strategy Masa-Israel-Journey listening","","",

<p>Earlier this month, Network For Good and TrueSense Marketing issued <a href=""http://www.onlinegivingstudy.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Online Giving Study</a> -- a great examination of online giving from 2003-2009 across various website, social networks, and portals that process donations via the Network for Good platform. While there are some limitations to the study, there are some great trends worth reviewing. One of my favorite findings has to do with the data regarding the major surge in donations in December--particularly between December 29-31.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>As stated on page 14 of the report:</p>
<blockquote>December is the strongest giving month for most organizations offline. It's even more so online. Further, it's not just the month of December that's spectacular,<strong> it's the last couple of days, and even last few hours that make the difference.</strong><em> (emphasis added)</em></blockquote>
<p>The fact that December is the biggest month for online donations is not altogether surprising. A few years ago, the team over at M+R have cited that ""nonprofits raise 40% of online donations during the fourth quarter of the year"" in their <a href=""http://e-benchmarksstudy.com/"" target=""new"">annual eNonprofits Benchmarks Study (2008 report based on 2007 data).</a> What is new and now clear is the trend that many organizations are receiving a bulk of those online donations not just in the last quarter, or even in the last month of the year, but in the last few days!<strong>There is still time for you to use this data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your nonprofit has a year-end campaign in progress, consider the drop date of your email appeal next week. Instead of sending early in the week, consider moving it closer to the end of the year OR even on the last day.</li>
<li>If your nonprofit only sends out one email appeal for its year-end or annual fund efforts, and that message has already been sent, consider sending a reminder to give next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know it seems silly, people <em>do</em> rush to get their donations in before midnight on December 31. Your mission is awesome, but sometimes the appeal of a tax deduction or adrenaline of a deadline can trigger gifts. And with the real-time, immediate element of giving through your website or charity portal, you can make this work for you.In case you need some inspiration, here are a few 'last chance' emails I received last year.</p>

(Ok I also had no idea I'd ever wear anything but flannel shirts and Birkenstocks, but that's another story...)</p>
<p>In the decade since, I've learned a few things. I not only dove into the world of online fundraising and found that I loved it--I slowly realized that my alma mater was actually something of an evil genius when it came to my new profession.</p>
<p>This has never been clearer than during the build-up to my recent ten-year reunion.</p>
<p><img alt=""john-belushi-college"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3435"" height=""526"" src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/sites/default/files/images/blog/john-belushi-college.jpg"" title=""john-belushi-college"" width=""348"" /></p>
<p>My school's alumni fundraising operation has been awe-inspiring to the point of being almost scary. Over the last year and a half I have received no less than 46 emails, 12 online appeals, 7 Facebook messages, 4 online videos, 3 online surveys, 2 phone calls, 2 matching gifts, 1 class book, a post-reunion picture gallery, and countless mail pieces.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not suggesting you go out and launch quite as intensive a campaign as all that. But since the reunion I've been itching to share many of my school's most interesting tactics with my nonprofit friends. So in celebration of my ten-year reunion, I'm sharing with you, dear reader...</p>
<h3>The top ten favorite fundraising tactics I was subjected to at my reunion (which you should steal if you can!)</h3>
<p><strong>10. Producing a Class Book for each reunion year. </strong><br /> Each alum could submit a page about themselves, and since the people I met were by far the most important part of my school experience, thumbing through the book kept me thinking about why I loved college and should give a gift. (This could be easily adapted for nonprofits by posting online stories about donors, volunteers, etc.)<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Letting you do everything online. </strong><br /> You needed a login to register for the reunion or submit your class book page online--but they made it easy by including your login inside each email, in case you forgot it. (Which I had!)</p>
<p><strong>8. Facebook stories about scholarships.</strong><br />Financial aid made college possible for me, and alumni gifts made that financial aid possible. The school hit that point home very effectively by letting students and alumni post, rank, read, and tag stories about how financial aid helped them on a specially designed Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>7. Getting my college friends to be fundraising accomplices.</strong><br /> I started getting non-blast emails from a freshman dorm-mate about six months before the reunion, urging me to register and give. The name recognition alone was enough to get me to open the emails--a great reason to get your best activists to email their friends!</p>
<p><strong>6. Using current students to make me feel guilty!</strong><br />I got online videos, appeals, and phone calls from current students who reminded me they depended on alumni-supported financial aid to go to school. (This worked not just because the students were earnest and adorable, but because I made those calls to alumni myself when I was a freshman.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Constantly setting deadlines. </strong><br /> There was a deadline to submit your class book page, a deadline to get a discounted ticket to the reunion, a deadline to have your gift matched--so many deadlines! And you know what? I didn't take any of these actions until I saw those deadline reminders. Plan for procrastinators like me!</p>
<p><strong>4. Holding mini-reunions.</strong><br />The highlight of the reunion was the mini-reunions, where the school arranged for all the people in my freshman dorm to have a separate happy hour. Again, by connecting me with the people who were closest to me in college, the school underscored why I should give.</p>
<p><strong>3. Unique match offers.</strong><br />I had never seen this before, but one match appeal had the offer that not only would your donation be doubled--but offered that if we reached the goal, the donor would also make a special one-time gift of $50,000. That motivated me for sure!</p>
<p><strong>2. A strategic deadline. </strong><br /> While I might have assumed the deadline to give was the reunion itself in October, they actually extended giving to December 31<sup>st</sup> to take advantage of the year-end giving boost. Smart, very smart.</p>
<p><strong>1. Weather update</strong><br />This may sound silly, but my overall favorite thing my school sent was a simple email, the week of the reunion itself, warning me that it might rain that weekend and I should pack a raincoat. There was no ask, and it was such a thoughtful detail that it made me want to give anyway!</p>
<p>And the million-dollar question? What finally got me to give my alumni gift? It's shameful but true--the last, last, no-really-Rachel-your-LAST chance email appeal I received on December 28<sup>th</sup>. Of course.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2131%1,2739%2,2670%3,2709%4,2709%5,2670%6,2739%7,2131%8","","","","blog/all-i-needed-know-about-fundraising-i-learned-my-ten-year-reunion","audience reunion storytelling year-end-fundraising year-end-fundraising storytelling reunion audience","audience reunion storytelling year-end-fundraising year-end-fundraising storytelling reunion audience","",

<p>My wish is for all of you to find a little more beauty in your life. One way to get more beauty is to go to Scotland. &nbsp;The landscape is stunning (obviously), the people are warm, the music is lively, the whisky is plentiful, and the food is (perhaps surprisingly) delectable. Since I can't send each of you to Scotland, I will instead give you a (literal) taste of its beauty. This is a recipe for a classic Scottish soup, called <em>cullen skink</em>.

<!--break-->
<p>Cullen skink is yet another delicious Scottish food that falls into the category of “sounds bleah.” In this case, I can tell you where the name <em>cullen skink</em> comes from. <em>Skink</em> is Scots for <em>soup</em>. This particular soup originated in the town of Cullen. Easy enough. I haven’t looked up where tablet and haggis get their names.</p>
<p>You don’t need a lot of ingredients for a proper cullen skink, but the most important is smoked haddock: &nbsp;</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/3e21585276e7305737a2e48ba6b2d96b/files/img_5041_300x225_0.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>Smoked haddock isn’t always the easiest thing to find in the United States. But if you live near a shop that sells British or Irish products, someone there might be able to point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>My wife and I are fortunate to live across the street from an Irish butcher (in Queens!), and they are occasionally well stocked with smoked haddock. Their smoked haddock is dyed (hence the orange color), and in an ideal world, it wouldn’t be. But the dye makes no difference to the taste, so don’t let that be a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>You’ll also need onion… &nbsp;potatoes…&nbsp;&nbsp;dairy products (butter, milk, cream)… &nbsp;…and some freshly ground pepper and (perhaps) a little salt.</p>
<p>Like many proper soups and stews, amounts can be estimated. If I’m making cullen skink for a small dinner party (6-10 people), I start with two smoked haddock fillets. I usually then use two large potatoes and one onion (I’ve found that a 2:1 potato-to-onion ratio is ideal).</p>
<p>So… How to make it!</p>
<p>Lay your smoked haddock fillets across a heavy-bottomed pot. Pour enough cold water over the fillets to cover them. The water will become the base for your soup. Turn on the heat and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, cover the pot and poach the haddock fillets for five minutes.</p>
<p>While that’s going, peel and dice your potatoes and onion. You’ll want them in pretty small pieces. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the haddock fillets from the water (now a smoky fish “stock”) and allow them to cool (I usually put them in a glass bowl).</p>
<p>Put your potato and onion into the soup pot and return the water to a boil. Boil them for ten minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.</p>
<p>Hey, does your whole kitchen/apartment/house smell like smoky fish yet? Isn’t it awesome? How much do your neighbors love you?</p>
<p>Toward the end of the veggie boiling time, you’ll need to flake the haddock fillets. Yes, you could do it with a fork, but I recommend using your fingers. The fillets may not have many bones, but this is your opportunity to pull out the ones that are there. So get your hands right in there and break the fish apart into bite-sized bits. (Don’t yet add it to the soup.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>After ten minutes of boiling the potatoes and onion, turn the heat down, and toss in a dollop of butter. This is a Scottish soup, nonprofiteers, so don’t fear the butter. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s somewhere between one and two tablespoons of butter. Get a potato masher and mash the butter into the potatoes and onions.</p>
<p>I actually like my cullen skink quite chunky, so I don’t mash too much. In fact, we lost our potato masher, and I make what amounts to a half effort at the mashing, using one of those pastry blender thingies. I just sort of run the pastry blender over the potatoes and onions until the butter is melted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep the heat on low, as you put the flaked haddock into the pot.</p>
<p>Then add some milk, a few good glugs of it. I’ve never measured this out; I always eyeball it. But for the love of all that is right in this world, please use whole milk.Robbie Burns will turn over in his grave if anything non-fat hits this recipe.</p>
<p>Also, cream. I love cream. I like my cullen skink to be a bit thicker than it is if I just use milk (yes, even whole milk). Cream is theoretically optional, but it will only make it better, so do yourselves a favor and add some cream. I admit that I ended up using that entire half-pint container for my recent batch, and the soup still wasn’t too heavy. In fact, it was awesome.</p>
<p>While that continues to heat up, grind some fresh pepper in there. Be generous. Pepper is the only spice you’ll need, and it’s important.</p>
<p>Pepper is the only spice? What about salt? Well, first of all, it’s not a spice; it’s a mineral. But also, you may not need it. Taste your skink before you add any. Some smoked haddock fillets are already really salty. So only add some salt if your tasting deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Your skink should look a little something like this (although it will be a brighter white color if you’ve managed to get non-dyed smoked haddock fillets). &nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as it’s hot, there’s no need to let it cook any longer. Feel free to serve immediately. Top it off with some fresh chives, because they’ll add some color and make it look all fancy-pants. And who doesn’t love a fancy-pants soup?</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/3e21585276e7305737a2e48ba6b2d96b/files/img_4995_300x225.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>Serve it with whatever you like with your soup. A salad is always nice, as is some bread and cheese (and if you can find a delicious cheddar from Scotland, particularly from the Isle of Orkney, it’ll be a bit of Scottish heaven).</p>
<p>Enjoy your cullen skink!</p>
<p>If, after your cullen skink experience, you’re looking for a well-matched, dairy-based sweet, may I recommend <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/?p=1173"">last year’s tablet recipe</a>?</p>
<p>Good luck getting more beauty in your lives in the upcoming year, nonprofiteers. I hope this taste of Scotland helps. And happy New Year!</p>

<p>In 2011, I wish for you to have a better commute. One way for a better commute is to get on your bike and do more cycling. I wish for more biking, because biking is fun. It's healthy. It's inexpensive. It's independent--no timetables or budget deficits but your own (I'm looking at you, MTA). Biking reduces emissions. It relieves congestion on roads and subways and busses. You get the gist.</p>
<p>You don't have to be intense about it, either. I'm not exactly what you would call a hard-core cyclist--I ride my bike to work most days, but if I'm feeling sniffly or have a nice pair of shoes I'd like to wear, I'll hop the subway with the best of them. Even if you only bike once in a while, getting outside and breathing the fresh(ish) NYC air makes for a better start to the day.So I wish for more biking.</p>
<p>But more biking is no good without responsible biking. City biking doesn't have to be dangerous, and it doesn't have to be obnoxious. But too often, it's both. Too many bikers behave as though the rules of the road don't apply to them--cruising through red lights, plopping down in the middle of crosswalks, zipping the wrong way down one-way streets. So drivers, pedestrians, and other bikers don't trust or respect them as fellow travelers (and fairly so, in many cases). It's a vicious cycle, and the result is that the streets are less safe for everyone--and that makes it harder for new cyclists to feel comfortable on the road.</p>
<p>So in 2011, I'd like to see more people on bikes, and I'd like to see those people heed traffic signals, use lights when riding at night, and generally behave like vehicles. Give it a try. I think we'll all find it makes for a better commute.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

The idea is to motivate us to go do new things in the city that we've never done before. We organize these special days once a week or once a month, depending on the various things going on in our lives.Over the past couple of years we have successfully crossed off many items from our cumulative bucket lists and ventured around the city and outer boroughs to do some pretty cool things. Here are three adventures that I recommend for those of you in or visiting New York City:</p>
<!--break-->
<p><strong>1. Dumpling tour of Chinatown</strong></p>
<p>We did our research (asking friends, mostly--very scientific) and assembled a list of the top-rated dumpling restaurants in Chinatown, with the modest goal of hitting up seven restaurants in one night. The list included: <a href=""http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/dumpling-house/"" target=""_blank"">Vanessa's dumpling house</a>, <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegetarian-dim-sum-house-new-york"" target=""_blank"">Vegetarian Dim Sum House</a>, <a href=""http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/new-wonton-garden/"" target=""_blank"">New Wonton Garden</a>, <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-dumpling-new-york"" target=""_blank"">Tasty Dumplings</a>, <a href=""#_msocom_6""></a><a href=""http://www.chinatownvegetarian.com/"" target=""_blank"">Buddha Bodai</a>, <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-spring-restaurant-new-york"" target=""_blank"">Sweet Spring Restaurant</a>, and <a href=""http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/"" target=""_blank"">Joe's Shanghai</a>.Google maps helped us chart our walking tour, and we began our mission to find the best vegetarian dumplings (yes, only vegetarian--sorry, we're not big fans of pork). We ended up eating a lot of great dumplings. We also only made it to four of the seven places due to larger-than-expected portions, an overall feeling of nausea, and a surprising lack of vegetarian options. Even so, my favorite was Vanessa's fried dumplings. Because everything tastes better fried.</p>
<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3527"" title=""IMG_7883"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/IMG_7883-300x225.jpg"" alt=""steamed vs fried dumplings"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p><strong>2. July 4<sup>th</sup> Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest</strong></p>
<p>We trekked out to Coney Island to watch <a href=""http://nathansfamous.com/PageFetch/"" target=""_blank"">Joey Chestnut</a> eat 60 hot dogs in ten minutes. It was a pretty awesome, disgusting site to see, but definitely a good time. Once we the contest was over, we walked around the boardwalk. Unfortunately, the lines were too long at the Cyclone. Plus, we value our lives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ferry ride to Staten Island</strong></p>
<p>The goal for this <em>Yom</em> was to take a ferry ride somewhere without spending a lot money. When we discovered that the <a href=""http://www.siferry.com/"" target=""_blank"">Staten Island Ferry</a> is free and runs regularly, we knew we were in for a beautiful summer evening. The ferry ride took about 30 minutes and gave us amazing views of lower Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island. Once on Staten Island we enjoyed a delicious dinner (in Staten Island!) at a restaurant close to the dock and then jumped back on the boat and went home. It was a simple, low-cost, and easy adventure.</p>
<p><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3528"" title=""DSCN2528"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/DSCN2528-300x225.jpg"" alt=""The countdown is always running"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>My goal for 2011 is to spend more time venturing into Brooklyn and tour more neighborhoods of the city. A few upcoming adventures to look forward to: an ice cream tour that starts at the <a href=""http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/brooklyn-ice-cream-factory/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Creamery</a>, continues by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to the <a href=""http://www.chinatownicecreamfactory.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chinatown Ice Cream Factory</a>, and ends at <a href=""http://16handles.com/"" target=""_blank"">16 Handles</a> in the East Village; brunch at <a href=""http://www.miriamrestaurant.com/"" target=""_blank"">Miriam</a>'s and the Brooklyn Museum; and a food tour of the Lower East side. Notice a theme?I wish for you all to create adventures wherever you are. Find new restaurants, explore different neighborhoods, and enjoy the people you're closest to. I would also love to hear about your adventures. We are always looking forward to our next <em>Yom Meyuchad</em>.Happy New Year.</p>

Nothing exciting happens on New Jersey Transit (unless you count train delays). People are rather civilized and keep to themselves. So with the absence of the MTA distractions I'd been so used to--loud stereo systems, train break dancers, costumes, and religious pontification--I needed something to bide my time during my travels back and forth to suburbia. So I started to read... a lot.</p>

<p>I'm not really picky about the things I read. My husband would even say that a lot of what I read is crap (perhaps because they have nothing to do with the decline and fall of our economic system). But the way I see it, you need to have a guilty pleasure (or two or three). Even our esteemed Strategist, Elizabeth Ricca, reads about gorillas and bats when she isn't conjuring up awesome ideas for our clients. And I'm sure that our Director of Copywriting, Dan Gunderman, reads <em>Star Magazine</em>. I can just feel it. But don't tell him I said that.</p>

What's that you say? You've had enough?Well, then, ahem...let's try again. As the newest member of the Big Duck team and a recent transplant from Atlanta, GA, my New Year's wish to you all (a.k.a. y'all) is a helping of <em>Southern Hospitality</em>.In the south, more often than not, hospitality comes in the form of food. What follows is a recipe for something called Hoppin' John. It's a southern traditional recipe best prepared and feasted on each New Year's Day, paired with a side of vinegary collards. The main ingredients of this classic meal symbolize the household's hopes for a prosperous and fortunate New Year--for example, leafy collards stand in for dollar bills and black-eyed peas represent coins.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3560"" title=""IMG_8367"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/IMG_8367-300x225.jpg"" alt=""IMG_8367"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>...Which all seems very capitalistic, until you realize that, historically, the humble ingredients in Hoppin' John would probably have come from the bounty of a local or family farm. To me, the recipe showcases resourcefulness: the ability to make something great out of, well, very little. Personally, the annual preparation of this dish allows me the chance to share wishes for prosperity and bounty with others.Plus it's veggie-heavy, tasty, and very warming. Best wishes for the New Year.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><strong>Hoppin' John (or eat the leftovers on January 2<sup>nd</sup> and call it Skippin' Jenny)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>3 c. dried black-eyed peas, covered in water and soaked overnight</p>
<p>2 c. white rice, dry1 large Vidalia onion, chopped</p>
<p>Red pepper flakes to taste</p>
<p>1 meaty ham hock (knee joint)</p>
<p>*First, drain the soaked beans and place them in a large pot along with 6 cups of water, the chopped onion, the red pepper flakes, and the ham hock. Bring contents to a boil and reduce the heat. Once the beans have softened, add the dry rice and cook until tender and fluffy, adding more water if necessary. Remove the ham bone, adding any residual meat to the pot, and serve with a side of boiled collards.* Not sure where to find this?

<p>I love the wintertime: glittering lights, ice-skating, holiday (and post-holiday) shopping...everything except the cold. And, somehow, no matter how my apartment's radiator clangs and gurgles, I'm <em>always</em> cold.This year, though, I've figured out a way to keep nice and toasty with some creative crafting/recycling: fuzzy, felted hand warmers. These make a quick and easy afternoon project and can be worn alone or over gloves for extra warmth. Best of all, they're a great way to give new life to those worn-out sweaters lurking at the back of everyone's closet. Instructions are below. I hope they help keep you cozy through the chilliest months of 2011.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find some old wool sweaters in colors (or patterns!) you like. Check the label to make sure your sweaters are 100% wool--otherwise the felting process won't work.</li>
<li>Cut the sweater(s) apart along the seams so you're left with 4 flat pieces (front, back, and two sleeves).</li>
<li>Run the pieces through the washing machine (with detergent) on the hot-wash cold-rinse cycle.</li>
<li>Toss the pieces in the dryer on high. When they come out, you should notice they've shrunk significantly and the individual knit stitches are hard to see--basically, it should look like felt. If you don't think your pieces look ""felty"" enough, repeat steps 3 and 4.</li>
<li>Cut 4 rectangles from your felt for the fronts and backs of your hand warmers. Mine measured about 4 in. x 8 in., but yours may vary depending on your hand size and how far up your arm you want them to reach.</li>
<li>Place 2 rectangles (1 front and 1 back) back-to-back and pin the edges. Stitch up the long edges, leaving a gap for your thumb about 1.5 in. long and 1.5 in. from the top. There's no need to bind off the raw edges--the felt shouldn't unravel.</li>
<li>Repeat step 6 for opposite hand, making sure thumb gap is on the opposite side.</li>
<li>Turn inside out, wear, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>That's what everyone seems to feel lately, myself included. If there were a wish that I could grant for people, it would be the ability to observe some simplicity in life.</p>
<p>We all have hobbies or other ways of decompressing after a long day or week, and mine is to get into the kitchen and cook a meal. My problem is that the menus I plan tend to be overly ambitious, and by the time I get home from work, decide what to eat with my wife, and do the shopping for the ingredients, well, what was originally a dinner for two becomes a midnight snack, cause that’s when things finally get done.</p>
<div id=""attachment_3520"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"">
<p class=""wp-caption-text"">A delicious, fancy schmancy spaghetti dish that took two hours to make.</p>
</div>
<p>I decided to take some steps to try to get the best of both worlds, where I could still get the satisfaction of cooking and having good food, but also doing it in a way with a minimal amount of time and hassle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the ingredients to a minimum. If I see a recipe with a long list of needed items, I put it away. In fact, if I see any cookbook in a store where all the recipes require too many ingredients and prep work, I won't even get it.</li>
<li>Do your prep work beforehand, and keep it to a minimum. Any restaurant chef will tell you that getting the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place"" target=""_blank"">mise en place</a>"" organized helps to get the food orders out the door in a timely fashion. Myself, I hate chopping, and so I'll either ask for some help while I do other prep, or do it way in advance to get it over with. Also, look into tools that will help make your job easier (i.e. garlic press!).</li>
<li>Speaking of tools... If you don't have one, get a slow cooker. A one pot wonder, this is one of the best investments I've ever made. Throw everything in there, and a couple hours later, you've got gold. Prep it in the morning before you go to work, and by the time you get home, you're read to eat.</li>
<li>Have an herb garden if you can do it. Just a small pot will do. We put ours by the window, and it's handy when your recipe calls for some herbs, and you don't want to go to the store to buy a whole package that you may not even finish.</li>
<li>If you can, plan ahead. Consider recipes that you can make in big batches on the weekend so that you can freeze some for later in the week—or bring to lunch. If your friends live close by, organize a meal swap, and trade some of your extra portions for others to get some variety.</li>
</ol>

We like lists, too.<br /><br /></p>
<h3></h3>","<p>It's a popular exercise, at the end of one year and beginning of the next, to make lists. We like lists, too.</p>
<p>Last January's ""<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/words-nonprofits-avoid-2010"" target=""_blank"">Words for Nonprofits to Avoid in 2010</a>"" turned out to be our most popular blog post of 2010. It warms the cockles of my heart to know that you all value words so much. As I look again at last year's list, I'm also pleased to see that I stand by my advice with regard to the words <em>system, infrastructure, capacity, impact</em>, and <em>catalyst</em>. And as for <em>Web site</em>, I'm thrilled that the latest edition of the <em>AP Styleboo</em>k has agreed to call <em>website</em> standard.</p>
<p>I'm not a totalitarian when it comes to words. I've got strong opinions on the subject, some of which are below, but heck, it's your voice. Use the words you want to use.</p>
<p>And remember that it is, in fact, your voice. Or your organization's. You have a unique perspective, so your voice should also be unique. (By the way, <em>unique</em> is a word I usually avoid, unless I actually mean ""one-of-a-kind."")</p>
<p>With that caveat, then, I've asked for input from my Big Duck colleagues, and we offer you a few words that might be worth avoiding in the next year. Some are jargon; some just personally annoy one or more of us; and some we're guilty of using ourselves.</p>
<h3><!--break-->In these economic times</h3>
<p>As we slog our way through this recession (recovery?), this phrase continues to get a lot of play from nonprofits, colleges, and others raising money. But can times be economic? If they can, wouldn't all times be economic then? It makes my head spin. And it becomes a meaningless phrase pretty quickly. Instead of using <em>in these economic times</em>, get specific. Explain how the economy is affecting your programming or why giving to your organization should be a priority even while people are struggling.</p>
<h3>More than ever</h3>
<p>Have you used the phrase, ""Your donation is needed now more than ever"" (or some variation) in your fundraising efforts? I'm certainly guilty of using it. Sometimes it's even true. Right after a natural disaster, for example, emergency donations really are needed more than ever. The problem, of course, is that it's desperately overused. And if your audiences see it every fundraising cycle, pretty soon they'll either think you're lying, or that you're always in a state of desperation. Probably not the best impression to leave on your audiences. Find a different phrase that compels people to act.</p>
<p>In politics, the overused phrase is ""the most important election of our lifetime."" I have enough memories of enough elections to know that the upcoming election is always the most important election of our lifetime. Sometimes it's true (I've certainly believed it more than once), but it's a phrase that loses meaning when you hear it every election cycle, from the presidential campaign all the way down to city council.</p>
<h3>Take it to the next level</h3>
<p>We can use<em> take it to the next level</em> in a lot of contexts. Sometimes we ask donors to give more money than they usually do (""Take your donation to the next level!""). Sometimes we ask activists to volunteer more time for our cause (""Take your commitment to the next level!""). Sometimes we want to tout the exciting growth at our organization (""We're taking our program to the next level!""). Well, therein lies the problem: it's universal because it's generic. When I catch myself using it, I can't help but feel that I've been lazy. There's certainly a better, clearer way of putting it. Get specific. Specificity will take your writing to the next level!</p>
<h3>Ideate</h3>
<p>Those of us who make our living using our creative skills to satisfy clients' needs may have heard this word creeping into regular use in the marketing vernacular. There's nothing wrong with the word itself, and to say that I sit here ideating for much the day isn't necessarily wrong. It just sounds pretentious. And I suspect that agencies use this word to keep the creative process hidden in a shroud of intellectual mystery, to make you--the client--feel like it's this thing you will never understand. You're on the outside of it, and nanny-nanny-boo-boo. Perhaps I overreact--and, frankly, using <em>ideate</em> is probably the most direct way to say that we come up with creative ideas--but it's a pompous word that takes the life out of what we do, which, truth be told, is mostly fun. We brainstorm, we collaborate, and we think creatively. I don't like the idea that I'm sitting here ideating.</p>
<h3>Literally</h3>
<p>I rather enjoy Vice President Joe Biden. He's like everyone's favorite uncle. He's affable and smart, and he very often says something utterly ridiculous. He also uses <em>literally</em> way too frequently and totally incorrectly. If you haven't noticed it before, listen to a speech or a press appearance. He's loves the word <em>literally</em>. And many people do. It's used for emphasis, and I get that, but no, you did not literally die from laughing.</p>
<h3>Bandwidth</h3>
<p>This very nearly made the list last year, and I've added it to this year's list because its use shows no signs of abating. If you're talking about your computer network's actual ability to process and transmit data (and the like), please feel free to use <em>bandwidth</em> to your heart's content. If you're talking about how busy you are, however, or someone's availability to work on something... Well, I tend to err on the side of humanizing. Especially in the nonprofit world. We are humans doing work that ultimately serves other humans. (This is similar to my issue with <em>infrastructure</em> on last year's list.) Let's not talk about ourselves as if we're computers. This one really ruffles some feathers over here at Big Duck, which is funny, because we're also guilty of using it. A lot.</p>
<h3>-centric</h3>
<p>In 1960, Billy Wilder made a terrific film (written by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) called <em>The Apartment</em>. (If you haven't seen it, remedy that immediately.) The original poster had this blurb on it: ""Movie-wise, there has never been anything like 'The Apartment' love-wise, laugh-wise, or otherwise-wise."" In the film, there was a supporting character who added <em>-wise</em> to a lot of his words. I wasn't alive in 1960, but I suspect that the writers were satirizing something common in the business world at the time. I think maybe we're entering a similar phase with <em>-centric</em>. Here at Big Duck, we already use <em>audience-centric, organization-centric,</em> and <em>user-centric </em>with some regularity. Lately, I've heard it added to other words.

<h3>The cloud</h3>
<p>Boy, this one's a real problem. ""Cloud computing"" is (or was) a specific technology. (If you'd like to know about the specific technology, <a href=""http://commoncraft.com/cloud-computing-video"" target=""_blank"">this video</a> is very helpful.) But now ""the cloud"" is thought of as a magic solution to any technological problem (""To the cloud!""), or, perhaps even worse, ""the cloud"" is synonymous with the internet. It's probably best to avoid using ""the cloud"" for the time being until the world has settled on a final meaning. Good thing I warned you: I bet a lot of you nonprofiteers have been throwing it around willy-nilly, wacky do-gooders that you are.</p>
<h3>Twitterverse</h3>
<p>(Also, the <strong>Twitterati</strong>, and anything else found in the <a href=""http://www.twittonary.com/"" target=""_blank"">Twittonary</a>.) Truth be told, I find some of these words to be quite fun, and I rather wish there was an easier way to browse the Twittonary. But let's avoid these words in formal writing. What do you say?<br />There are many more. And some of you may have your own words--or even your own lists. What words are getting too much play in your sphere? How about <em>sphere</em>? Let's continue the conversation in the comments.<br />Thanks for reading and have a happy year of writing, nonprofit fans!</p>
<h3>Credits:</h3>
<p>To put together this year's list, we did a bit of research and found a couple of nice links that include jargony, overused vocabulary you might want to avoid (or at least be aware of):</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the <a href=""http://www.lssu.edu/banished/current.php"" target=""_blank"">Lake Superior State University's annual list of ""banished words""</a> that inspired the original post. So once again, we offer a shout-out. I'm particularly happy to see <em>fail</em> and <em>wow factor</em> on their 2011 list.</li>
<li><em>The New York Times's</em> annual ""<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/weekinreview/19sifton.html?_r=1&amp;hp"" target=""_blank"">Words of the Year</a>"" article is always a pleasure and includes words that annoy (such as <em>belieber</em>) and words that bring pleasure (long live the <em>vuvuzela</em>).</li>
<li>Count on <em>Advertising Age</em> to be three steps ahead of the rest of us with their list of ""<a href=""http://adage.com/bookoftens2010/article?article_id=147583"" target=""_blank"">Jargoniest Jargon</a>"" that includes some terms we've never even heard before. So the good news is that they're not all overused yet!</li>
<li>We also rather liked this compilation of the <a href=""http://blog.linkedin.com/2010/12/14/2010-top10-profile-buzzwords/"" target=""_blank"">Top Ten Overused Buzzwords on LinkedIn Profiles</a>. So if you're looking for job opportunities, this list might be useful for you. Also of note and/or interest: there's a lot of overlap between how people describe their most employable selves and how nonprofits describe themselves to their various audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you enjoy lists like these, a cursory Google search will get you many, many more.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1408%1,1409%2,1416%3","","","","words-avoid-2011-edition","words personality messaging copywriting","","",

<p>I'm <a href=""/staff/abby_alisha_brenna"" target=""_blank"">Alisha, the copy intern</a> here at Big Duck. I've been working at Duck HQ for about a month now, polishing my writing skills and upping my caffeine intake. So far my time here has been great, (and I would say that even if they weren't showering me with free Metrocards). The folks here are smart and creative and generous with their baked goods. What's not to love?</p>
<p>But this isn't some shameless intern recruitment plug. (<a href=""/about/internships"" target=""_blank"">Although we are on the lookout...</a>) This is about you, Do-Gooder, and interns can be a real boost to a nonprofit. Your organization gets the benefit of our creativity, energy, and manpower, and we get to build our resume. It's a win-win-win-win-win.</p>
<p>Especially if you use us correctly.</p>
<p>Does that sound too ominous? I promise it's not. But to help you avoid the dreaded <a href=""http://blogs.forbes.com/susanadams/2011/06/23/summer-internship-horror-stories-and-how-to-avoid-them/"" target=""_blank"">Intern Horror Story</a>, Here are four tips guaranteed to keep everybody happy.</p>
<p><strong>1. Give us something to do.<br /> </strong>It's hard to be a boss. Not only do you have your own work to manage, you've also got this extra person hanging around waiting to be told what to do. But here's the thing - <em>we want to help you.</em> Better yet - <em>we can. </em>One of the things I appreciate most about <a href=""/about/team/dan_gunderman"">Dan</a>, the Big Duck Copy Director, is that every day he has something for me to work on. At first the assignments were small, but it was all real work. Meaning, if he asked me to write copy for the Big Duck website, it wasn't just practice - it was copy that he actually intended to use. Trusting that I could do more than data entry gave me a sense of purpose, and it showed Dan that I could be trusted to help out with bigger assignments (including some client work).</p>
<p>Win-win-win-win-win!</p>
<p><strong>2. Find out our strengths.</strong><br />A piece of advice: Never ask an intern what they're good at. It's an intimidating question and encourages exaggerating. Instead, ask them what they like to do. You're bound to get a more honest answer, which can help you determine your intern's skill set. (If a person loves to illustrate, chances are they're going to be pretty good at it.) Pairing your intern with assignments that interest them leads to happiness, and a happy intern is a good intern.</p>
<p>Now, you may be asking, ""Why should I care about my intern's emotional state? Aren't they here to bring me coffee and amuse me with their tiny faces?"" Let me let you in on a little secret: interns talk. Make our experience a positive one and we will be spectacular brand ambassadors, talking up your organization to anyone who'll listen. And who doesn't like free advertising? Nobody, that's who.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/57363693_1.jpg"" style=""width: 338px; height: 377px;"" /><br /><small>photo by: Martin Holtkamp</small></p>
<p><strong>3. Feedback, feedback, feedback.</strong><br />Dan gives great feedback - which isn't to say that it's always positive. (Trust me, the first few weeks were a steep learning curve.) Yes, he's quick to point out what I do well, but more importantly, he treats my work with respect. If edits are needed, he takes the time to explain why the changes were made and listens if I disagree. This helps me feel like I'm part of the process, and part of the creative team, which makes me want to go the extra mile to produce stellar work.</p>
<p>I'm happy, Big Duck is happy. Win-win-win-win-win.</p>
<p>Feedback doesn't have to be a big production, but it does need to be consistent. Aim for daily contact, if you can manage it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Give them something to put on a resume.</strong><br />There's no way to sugarcoat this: interns want a job. Very possibly from you. If that's not an option, the best thing you can do is to let them contribute to client work. (Education is great, but it doesn't look nearly as impressive on a resume.) When it's time for them to move on, put them in contact with folks you know who might be hiring. Teach them how to explain the work they did for you, so they can talk about it in job interviews.</p>
<p>In other words, help them launch. Your karma points will be huge.</p>

<p>Even with the fall of our local New York Jets, most New Yorkers will be tuned in to watch the Steelers take on the Packers. (Though the Madison Avenue types will probably only watch for the commercials.)</p>
<p>But with nine million people in the New York City area, our local PBS station, Thirteen, sees an opportunity. What about all those people who just don't care about football? What about those who might actually go out of their way to do an anti-Super Bowl celebration?</p>
<p>I recently received my weekly newsletter for what to watch on Thirteen, and I noticed a cute little sidebar promo, right there in the email:</p>
<p>Masterpiece Marathon on Super Bowl Sunday</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing says football like Jane Austen. Ok, that might be a stretch, but whether you're looking for some pre-game drama or a sports alternative -- look no further than the world of Jane Austen. Beginning at 1:30pm on Sun., 2/6, Masterpiece Classic provides almost 10 hours of your favorites, including <i>Emma</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there is some good positioning, nonprofiteers. Leave it to <a href=""http://www.thirteen.org/"" mce_href=""http://www.thirteen.org/"" target=""_blank"">Thirteen.org</a> to position themselves as <i>the</i> alternative to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Even if others make this claim in the run up to the Biggest Sports Event of the Year, I doubt any of the other anti-Super Bowl alternatives will have the content to back it up. Let's face facts here. The stories of Jane Austen--especially nearly ten freakin' hours of Jane Austen--are the Bizarro Super Bowl.</p>
<p>(Although I hear that the young Margaret Dashwood <i>was</i> known for her shockingly spirited blitz from blindside.)</p>
<p>Well played, Thirteen. As far as I'm concerned, you own the anti-Super Bowl space. Well played indeed.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1","","","","nice-positioning-thirteenorg","Positioning superbowl Jane-Austen","","",

<p>So how can you make sure your social media presence is benefiting both your organization and yourself? Here are ten steps to get you started...</p>
<p><b>1. Decide your goals for communicating in social media.</b></p>
<p>Consider your personal goals and those of the organization you work for. Where do these goals meet and how do they differ? For example, say one of your organization's goals is to connect to donors using social media and one of your own goals is to be seen as a seasoned fundraising professional. As a staff person, you might update your Facebook status or tweet about how passionate you are about the issue and offer ways people can donate. Perhaps you could even <a href=""http://exchange.causes.com/resources/features/birthday-wish/"" mce_href=""http://exchange.causes.com/resources/features/birthday-wish/"" target=""_blank"">donate your birthday</a> to raise funds for your cause.</p>
<p>These efforts could help your contacts connect both to you and the organization, while also demonstrating your understanding about how to use these tools professionally. Of course, your personal goals could be just that. Maybe you want to cook more, so you follow and read blogs and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Tweet-Twitter-Communitys-cookbook/dp/1579654266"" mce_href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Tweet-Twitter-Communitys-cookbook/dp/1579654266"" target=""_blank"">updates about new recipes to try</a>.</p>
<p><b>2. Draft a personal positioning statement for yourself.</b><br /> What is the big idea you want people to associate with you? What should come to mind when they hear or see your name? To answer this, start by thinking about not only how you would describe yourself but also how others describe you too. Google yourself and see what the interwebs have to say about who you are. Now stop and think about how you <i>want</i> the world to see you. What are you passionate about and what makes you unique? Who are the people you are trying to reach?</p>
<p>Get out some paper and a pen and write a personal positioning statement. Try this structure:</p>
<p>I am a ___________ &lt;qualifying adjectives&gt; in _________&lt;niche topic&gt; for __________&lt;audience&gt;.</p>
<p><b>3. Identify what social media tools best tell your story and find any places where your presence is required.</b></p>
<p>Tack that personal positioning statement up at your desk and hop on Google to see where your audience is. By searching various keyword phrases, try to find the specific social networks, blogs, and other online hangouts popular among your topic and target audience. At the time of this writing, location-based networks like Foursquare and Facebook Places are all the rage--but that doesn't mean you have to be there and check-in to every office, restaurant, and store you go to. If the audiences you are trying to connect with love these tools, great. Maybe you should too. On the flip side, your community may be made up of <a href=""http://blogs.forrester.com/jackie_rousseau_anderson/10-09-28-latest_global_social_media_trends_may_surprise_you"" mce_href=""http://blogs.forrester.com/jackie_rousseau_anderson/10-09-28-latest_global_social_media_trends_may_surprise_you"" target=""_blank"">spectators</a> and lurkers--""liking"" your posts or mentioning a blog you wrote when they see you, but never commenting online. Again, let your personal positioning statement be your guide.</p>
<p><b>4. Make it easy for peers and friends to find you.</b></p>
<p>It all starts with your name. Okay, this should be an easy one, but who owns your name online? Have you set a vanity URL for your Facebook and LinkedIn profiles? Is your Twitter handle similar to your Skype handle? Do you own your name as a domain? Do you include your organization in your handle? Beyond consistency, it is good to <a href=""http://namechk.com/#popular"" mce_href=""http://namechk.com/#popular "" target=""_blank"">claim your name</a> before someone else does.</p>
<p><b>5. Select keywords or phrases to listen for online.</b></p>
<p>Pick three-to-five phrases that you want people to associate with your name. Perhaps it's that same list of keyword phrases you just searched for to find your audience. <a href=""http://www.socialbrite.org/2011/01/10/guide-to-monitoring-social-media/"" mce_href=""http://www.socialbrite.org/2011/01/10/guide-to-monitoring-social-media/ "" target=""_blank"">Set up tools to listen for these terms</a>, like Google alerts (for web and blog mentions) and Twilerts (for Twitter mentions). You might even use these terms to find groups of like-minded folks on LinkedIn or a niche network on Ning. The goal here is to get a sense of the conversation before jumping in as well as responding when your name/topic is mentioned.</p>
<p><b>6. Be yourself--and let your personality shine.</b></p>
<p>If we surveyed your partner, your family, your co-workers, and others, what words would they use to describe you? Are you snarky and feisty or serious and academic? Are you helpful and responsive or deliberate and reserved? Love or hate her, I'm sure a number of adjectives come to mind when you think of Madonna--revolutionary, adaptive, controversial, awesome, etc. Knowing the flavor you want to leave in people's mouths when they hear your name can help guide the content you write and how frequently you post in various channels.</p>
<p><b>7. Determine how much time can you spend on social media.</b></p>
<p>Sure you can block out time to update your status on various networks, write some copy for a blog, record a podcast, etc. but the more active you get, the more responsive you'll need to be. How much time can you spend and add on to your already busy day? If you are not sure, enter into new tools lightly. Better to do one or two things well then spread yourself out too thin and let your profile or presence lapse. Outdated content can have a negative impact on your reputation and do more harm than if you weren't there at all.</p>
<p><b>8. Be honest about your affiliations and connections.</b></p>
<p>If you are the <a href=""http://smartblogs.com/socialmedia/2011/01/12/measuring-and-monitoring-for-nonprofit-social-media-success-a-q-and-a-with-nwfs-danielle-brigida/"" mce_href=""http://smartblogs.com/socialmedia/2011/01/12/measuring-and-monitoring-for-nonprofit-social-media-success-a-q-and-a-with-nwfs-danielle-brigida/ "" target=""_blank"">social media strategist</a> for your nonprofit (a growing profession) or even a vocal supporter, know that others will consider you a representative of the organization. If you are worried about this association, make a disclaimer in your profile or posts. You should also review your organization's <a href=""http://socialmediagovernance.com/policies.php?f=5"" mce_href=""http://socialmediagovernance.com/policies.php?f=5 "" target=""_blank"">social media guidelines</a> or help create them.</p>
<p><b>9. Follow people you can learn from and be a good sharer.</b></p>
<p>There's a good chance that someone (or several people) are competing for the same positioning as you. The thing that makes you unique is... well... you--your personality, your content, and your perspective. But learn from your competitors. Follow/friend them and share their content. Your audience will judge you by the company you keep, so this is certainly a good practice to get into.</p>
<p><b>10. Measure your impact overall and per channel.</b></p>
<p>There's much ado about <a href=""http://kdpaine.blogs.com/kdpaines_pr_m/2010/01/measuring-engagement-is-just-another-term-for-measuring-relationships.html"" mce_href=""http://kdpaine.blogs.com/kdpaines_pr_m/2010/01/measuring-engagement-is-just-another-term-for-measuring-relationships.html "" target=""_blank"">measuring ROI in social media</a>. In short, coming up with a metric that will make you feel validated for all the time you are putting is hard. Here are a few things you can track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Followers, friends, and subscriber counts</li>
<li>Retweets, clicks, and shares</li>
<li>Comments, favorites, discussions</li>
<li>Key contacts, referrals, recommendations, and testimonials</li>
</ul>
<p>But impact isn't just a numbers game. Take time to reflect on your brand every few months, ask these questions again, and see how you might change or evolve your approach.</p>

Many nonprofits have one, and too many of them go unread. Here are a few simple steps you can take to help yours pop to the top of the inbox.</p>","<p>E-newsletters. Many nonprofits have one, and too many of them go unread. Here are a few simple steps you can take to help yours pop to the top of the inbox.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Get clear about your goals.</b><br /> Do you want your newsletter to keep your donors interested and informed? Inspire volunteers or activists to get involved? Inform members about programming and resources? Decide what you're hoping your e-news will achieve, and write and design it with those goals mind. If you have multiple goals, put them in priority order—it helps with decision-making.</li>
<li><b>Give the people what they want.</b><br /> If your e-newsletter isn't interesting and valuable to the recipient, it'll never get opened. So how can you create an email so awesome that people look forward to seeing your name in their inboxes? Brainstorm about what you can offer that will be of use or interest to the folks on your list, and if you're not sure, send out a survey or make a few phone calls and find out.</li>
<li><b>When it comes to layout, forget everything you ever knew about print newsletters.</b><br /> I realize that I'm being a tad dramatic with this one, but I see many nonprofit emails that look suspiciously similar to (and in some cases, exactly the same as) the organization's print newsletters. Printed materials and emails are both useful communications tools, but they're very different media, and each deserves its own approach. Email recipients have shorter attention spans, less patience, higher expectations of relevance and timeliness. So choose a format and content that are well-suited to email and to your audience's needs—simple, short, and easy to skim.</li>
<li><b>Strive for simplicity.</b><br /> Your organization is doing so many wonderful things—how can you choose just a few to tell your subscribers about? It can be tough to be selective, but unless you try, you may end up with a newsletter so full of information that it's overwhelming and difficult to sift through. The best emails are focused, targeted, and well-organized, so that it's easy to spot the most important information.</li>
<li><b>Timing is everything.</b><br /> How often you send your e-news and when can make a big difference to your open and click-through rates. The right time to send your e-newsletters varies list to list, but the general rule of thumb is midweek, midday. If you blast your emails at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday, you probably won't see as many clicks as if you send it at noon on a Wednesday.<br /> In terms of frequency, most nonprofits find that monthly is just about right: not too much, not too little, and manageable for staff to produce. However, if you find that you're trying to cram a massive amount of news into your monthly emails (and you're sure your list really wants to hear about all of it) or your content is particularly time-specific (like notices about regular meetings or programs), weekly or biweekly may be the way to go. If you can't commit to producing an e-newsletter at least monthly, you may want to hold off for now—it's hard to build relationships online if your recipients can't expect to hear from you regularly.</li>
<li><b>Use your subject lines to inform and intrigue.</b><br /> ""November 2010 E-news"" doesn't give me much to go on. ""How you can help solve the climate crisis,"" on the other hand, gives me a much clearer picture of why I should be interested in opening your message.<br /> That said, some recipients like to know up front that they're opening your e-newsletter, so a clue might be in order—the American Red Cross, for example, starts their e-news subject lines with ""One Minute Update - "" so that recipients know what to expect. Test and see what your list likes.</li>
<li><b>The name of the game is improvement.</b><br /> After every issue, look at the stats. How many clicks? How many opens? How many unsubscribes? Try new things once in a while (e.g. layouts, subject lines, sender names, etc.), and make note of what works best. Maybe you'll learn that sending your e-news from your Executive Director's name generates more opens than sending it from a generic account. Perhaps you'll discover that linking to a full article on your website, with just a blurb in the email itself, is a great driver of traffic. With careful monitoring and thoughtful updates, you can make each email better than the last.</li>

But I am old enough that we didn't have email at my college until my senior year. And gosh, when email arrived it was a spectacular wonder. So fast. So convenient.</p>
<p>Even now, all these years later, email is my primary mode of communication. I don't much care for phone conversations. I don't know my own cell phone number (I don't even know where my cell phone is right now). What can I say? I'm a writer, and I like to be out of touch from time to time. It helps me get things done.</p>
<p>I have one email address that I use solely for shopping, signing online petitions, etc. As much as possible, I try to filter all my junk mail through it. And it gets flooded with emails from advocacy organizations, political parties, and the Mets.</p>
<p>As I'm sure you all know by now, email plays a vital role in any good online campaign, whether you're raising money or getting people to take action. And the message can be up-to-the-minute with whatever the latest news about your action is.</p>
<p>Or very nearly up-to-the-minute, anyway.</p>
<p>Last week, as events unfolded in Egypt, I received an email from an advocacy organization, asking me to call the White House to encourage President Obama to put pressure on President Mubarak to resign.</p>
<p>The only trouble is that President Mubarak had resigned at least two hours earlier. The Facebook status updates, the tweets, and the home pages of every newspaper's website had seemingly long announced his resignation and yet, here I was, being asked to take urgent action.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>So does this mean that email is simply too slow for today's online campaigns? One British nonprofit makes me think the answer might be yes...</p>
<p>This morning, as I was catching up on my backlog of left-leaning propaganda, I read <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/158282/how-build-progressive-tea-party"" mce_href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/158282/how-build-progressive-tea-party"" target=""_blank"">this fascinating article</a>. The writer discusses a protest group, UK Uncut, that performs sit-ins all around the United Kingdom at storefronts whose corporate owners have giant unpaid tax bills. Their premise is that, rather than cut important programs, the government should be getting these slackers to pay their bills.</p>
<p>And until that happens, they're going to disrupt business. They shut down one of the UK's biggest retailers at its flagship location in London on the Saturday before Christmas. Ouch.</p>
<p>The most fascinating thing to me about this article about UK Uncut was just how they organize, which is, of course, mostly through Twitter and Facebook. More than that, though, it's utterly decentralized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The old protest movements were modeled like businesses, with a CEO and a managing board. This protest movement, however, is shaped like a hive of bees, or like Twitter itself. There is no center. There is no leadership. There is just a shared determination not to be bilked, connected by tweets. ... Think of it as an open-source protest, or wikiprotest. It uses Twitter as the basic software, but anyone can then mold the protest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And by empowering the individual activists, the action goes way beyond the typical ""clickivism."" People actually get out of their chairs and hit the streets.</p>
<p>It's not any nonprofit that can decentralize its advocacy work the way the UK Uncut does. UK Uncut has absolutely no control over the actions of any of their protesting participants. If I were Director of Communications at a nonprofit that did advocacy work around a model like that, the idea would terrify me.</p>
<p>But it's hard not to imagine that we're moving in this direction. It was just a few years ago, after all, that nonprofits were terrified to let their audiences participate in anything known as ""Web 2.0""? Anyone could comment on the blog. A few voices could make a major stink on a community site.</p>
<p>And although the ""traditional"" tools are still too important to give up, it's also probably no longer enough to think of your campaigns as just an email or a Facebook page or a series of blog posts.</p>
<p>Apparently, the revolution will be tweeted. And it's a spectacular wonder to see, just like email, my senior year of college.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1405%1,1412%2","","","","email-too-slow","Campaigns Twitter social-media revolution email","","",

<p>Beverly gave a great presentation about how she and her team at March of Dimes have used the web and social media to reach out to women in the Spanish–speaking community. By 2050, the number of Hispanic women of childbearing age is expected to increase 92 percent, so over the last 15 years the <a href=""http://www.marchofdimes.com/"" mce_href=""http://www.marchofdimes.com/"" target=""_blank"">March of Dimes</a> has been committed to including the Hispanic community in its mission to help women have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies. With <a href=""http://advertising.aol.com/research/white-papers/hispanic-cyberstudy"" mce_href=""http://advertising.aol.com/research/white-papers/hispanic-cyberstudy"" target=""_blank"">the Hispanic online population growing faster than any other online population</a>, the web and social media are increasingly important ways to reach the community.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""mceWPmore"" mce_src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif"" src=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif"" title=""More..."" />Throughout Beverly's presentation, my fellow attendees asked lots of good questions, making for an interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key takeaways I, er, took away from it all:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hispanic community is the fastest–growing minority group in the United States, making it an increasingly large and important audience for many nonprofits.</li>
<li>As the stats at the beginning of this post suggest, mobile communication (through text messaging and mobile internet access) can be key when reaching out to the Hispanic community. Many Hispanics are bypassing laptop and desktop computers and accessing the web directly from their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"" mce_href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"" target=""_blank"">smartphones</a> and other mobile devices (iPads, iPods, e-readers and all that jazz).</li>
<li>As with the rest of the population, Twitter isn't all that popular within the Hispanic community—<a href=""http://www.edisonresearch.com/twitter_usage_2010.php"" mce_href=""http://www.edisonresearch.com/twitter_usage_2010.php"" target=""_blank"">only 11.3 percent of the online Hispanic population uses the service</a> (in part, Beverly suggested, because communicating in 140 characters or less is even harder in Spanish).</li>
<li>When it comes to writing content in Spanish, it may not be enough to translate what you have in English directly into Spanish. To really resonate with your audience, your blog (or Facebook page, or Twitter feed, or YouTube video) needs to be culturally appropriate as well as language appropriate. For their <a href=""http://www.nacersano.com/"" mce_href=""http://www.nacersano.com/"" target=""_blank"">Spanish–language website for pregnancy and newborn information</a>, for example, the March of Dimes used a team of Hispanic designers and writers to build a very different site from the <a href=""http://www.marchofdimes.com/pregnancy/pregnancy.html"" mce_href=""http://www.marchofdimes.com/pregnancy/pregnancy.html"" target=""_blank"">English–language version</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beverly will be giving a more in–depth version of the presentation as part of the <a href=""http://e.myntc.zerista.com/event/member?item_id=842880"" mce_href=""http://e.myntc.zerista.com/event/member?item_id=842880"" target=""_blank"">Engaging Latinos Online</a> breakout session at next month's <a href=""http://www.nten.org/ntc"" mce_href=""http://www.nten.org/ntc"" target=""_blank"">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a>.

And then, uh oh, you remember that last pesky detail--who's going to write the content that will populate your beautiful new site?</p>
<p>The process of re-writing or re-evaluating web copy is often hurriedly tacked on to the end of the web development process. But, as usability expert Jakob Nielsen recently found, the lack of clear and compelling web content is <a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/nonprofit-donations.html"" mce_href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/nonprofit-donations.html"">the number one complaint that potential donors cited about nonprofit websites</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/jurney.newsroomduckcall_0.jpg"" style=""width: 534px; height: 314px;"" /></p>
<p>As Big Duck tackled our own site redesign--which you'll see in just a few weeks (woot!)--here's what we found most helpful in the process of writing, updating, and editing content from the old site to the new:</p>
<p><b>Assign one content director, but share the load among several writers.</b></p>
<p>Website users will jump from page to page on your site, so all of those pages should work together as a unified whole. For this reason, we started our web content process with one person. Our content director--using the site redesign strategy outlined in our project brief as a guide--was tasked to write the direction for all pages, make sure content followed the logic of our navigation, and assign a writer, an editor and a proofer for each page.</p>
<p><b>Take the time to give detailed instructions. It's worth it.</b></p>
<p>So what kind of direction did the content director end up giving our writers? Very detailed. We circulated a content spreadsheet with specific writing directions for each page, including exactly what needed to be communicated, any calls to action, links to include, reference material that could be used to write the copy, and word count. Each page also had a designated writer, reviewer, and proofer.</p>
<p><b>Urge writers, editors, and proofers to block off time early.</b></p>
<p>To make sure that writers blocked off enough time to actually use our content spreadsheet, we then sent this heads up to writers, editors, and proofers:</p>
<p>You, lucky Duck, have been chosen as one of the writers of web copy for the new Big Duck website. Aren't you excited? You are assigned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write six pages between 10/19 and 11/9</li>
<li>Edit nine pages between 11/10 and 11/16</li>
<li>Incorporate edits to the pages you wrote between 11/16 and 11/23</li>
<li>Proof six pages between 11/24 and 12/3</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Give your team a clear strategic background.</b></p>
<p>Our instructions didn't end at scheduling. We wanted writers to know the strategy guiding the content direction, so we included a brief overview of the goals of the redesign. We also attached Big Duck's brandraising guide (i.e. our style guide) as a reference for recommended tone and style, and sent comps of the new site design for visual context.</p>
<p><b>Provide clear instructions and structure.</b></p>
<p>The intrepid Jenna Silverman was managing the content development process, and we tried to minimize the amount of work she had to do to keep everything in a standard format. For this reason we gave all writers, editors, and proofers standard naming convention for drafts (Ex: BigDuck_PAGETITLE_v1). Then we set up folders on our server, named according to the site map (Ex: COPY &gt; About Big Duck &gt; v1 &gt; BigDuck_OurTeam_v1.doc) so writers could simply save their drafts there instead of overwhelming Jenna's inbox with attachments.</p>
<p><b>Once the content is incorporated, have one reader review the site in context.</b></p>
<p>Our detailed instructions aside, we knew that some aspects of the copy would inevitably read differently once in context. So after the copy was loaded into our new design, we had one staff member block off time to do a final review of the site copy before launch. Just in case!</p>
<p>Have you come up some other good ways to manage the copywriting process for your website?</p>
<p>Please share it in the comments section!</p>

<p>Here are five tips to help ensure that the email you send inviting people to take your survey gets good results.</p>

<li><strong>Personalize it.</strong> If you upload your recipient's names and email addresses, most online survey tools can mail-merge so the email is personalized. An email that begins 'Dear Sarah' is much more likely to get me to respond than one that says, 'Dear friend'. Not to mention, many programs can send 'nudge' messages to folks who haven't completed the survey yet.</li>
<li><strong>Provide an incentive to complete it.</strong> Got a $25 Itunes or Amazon gift certificate you're willing to give away? Tell them about it. They'll be more likely to complete and enter their information if there's something interesting in it for them, too. Just let them know that completing the survey enters them automatically in a raffle for the gift.</li>
<li><strong>Set a deadline and tell them up front.</strong> A subject line such as, ""We'd like your opinion about XX&nbsp; by August 1<sup>st</sup>"" let's them know up-front what you're asking for, and makes the action you're asking them to take more explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Tell them what you'll do with their ideas.</strong> A sentence like 'your input will help us make sure we're investing our limited resources in the right places' or 'your input will help us shape our work moving forward' lets them know why you're doing the survey, and might make them feel more connected to your work.</li>
<li><strong>Send it from someone real.</strong> Use your name, job title, and real email address so the email feels like it came from a real human being who cares what they think, not a computer.</li>

<p>Yep, new ideas are great—but real success usually comes from sustained efforts.</p>","<p>We’re still in the first few months of 2011—time for new ideas, right? Perhaps you’re busy thinking up new fundraising campaign concepts. Or maybe figuring out new ways to conduct outreach or mobilize your grassroots?</p>
<p>Thinking up new ideas is fun. It gets our creative juices flowing and makes our work feel fresh and new, even when we’re dealing with essentially the same content.</p>
<p>Yep, new ideas are great—but real success usually comes from sustained efforts.</p>
<p>Take a look, for instance, at the big nonprofits that make the most money on direct mail or email. Do they send a new letter out every month? Nope. They use controls. If they get a new idea, they’ll test it, then monitor the performance and use it to inform future actions. If something’s working they don’t change it. Change comes cautiously—and only when informed by good data.</p>
<p>The trick is to marry the inspiration and momentum of new ideas with the nuts and bolts that are the essence of a successful direct response machine.</p>
<p>In his 2001 book “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300385205&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Good To Great</a>”, Jim Collins talks about a number of principles successful companies employ to grow and sustain success. One of my favorites is the “flywheel.” Basically, the idea is that you have to build momentum before you see real results: getting started can be rough going and hard work. Nonprofits that have successful direct response programs understand the flywheel principal: they’re building and sustaining a machine.</p>
<p>So how do you build a direct response fundraising flywheel with momentum? Here are three tips:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Plan to do it more than once.</b> Trying out direct mail or email asks for the first time? Budget the resources to do it consistently over time so you can capture useful data and start to see results. A one-time direct mail campaign or one-time email ask isn’t likely to do enough for you to warrant the effort they require to develop. Instead, start your direct response program with a three-year commitment to testing and measuring before you expect it to be profitable.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Do less; review and refine more.</b> Reviewing results (response rates, click throughs, Google analytics, etc) takes time—but we rarely plan for that. Instead, we anticipate that most of the time goes into creating the stuff. Analytics process gets short shrift. Try creating fewer pieces and spending more time reviewing the results of your work, using that data to inform future initiatives. Over time, each project will be smarter and better developed, leading to better results in the long-term.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Work with a pro.</b> Direct response success is part art, part science. Work with a pro that understands the science and can guide you through it. You should see the benefits of that work in your results. If you can’t afford to hire a consultant or an agency, read books. Mal Warwick’s books, in particular, are great resources for folks new to direct response fundraising.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1405%2","","","","the_direct_response_fundraising_flywheel","Fundraising Campaigns direct-response direct-mail creativity","","",

<p><!--break--></p>
<p>You can tell I'm particularly excited about this topic because I'm breaking my own rule about avoiding exclamation points!</p>
<p>Writers are notoriously stubborn and unforgiving about grammatical rules and language usage. I'm not immune. I am deeply resistant to using these new <i>OED</i>-approved words. It will take a whole heck of a lot of convincing for me to type those in any context other than discussing the initialisms themselves.</p>
<p>So what would convince me to use <i>OMG</i>, <i>LOL</i>, <i>&lt;3</i>, <i>TMI</i>, and even <i>FYI</i>? Only one thing. The right audience.</p>
<p>Every word we put down on the page--paper or electronic--we write for an audience. In the nonprofit world, that means we write for our donors, our advocates, and our participants. We never write for ourselves.</p>
<p>So when I resist using <i>OMG</i>, <i>TMI</i>, etc., it's only because I personally (and correctly, I might add) hate those words.</p>
<p>And if I were writing an email newsletter for the AARP, it would be deeply inappropriate to slip a <i>WTF</i> in there. But if I were sending out a text-to-give email to a bunch of thirteen-year-old girls at a Rebecca Black concert (look her up, if you dare), dropping a few <i>LOL</i> bombs wouldn't be out of the question.</p>
<p>(Asking for donations from thirteen-year-old girls raises another whole set of questions about strategy, not to mention ethics, but that's a discussion for another time.)</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, nothing I write at the moment warrants using these newly approved words. But if Big Duck were to suddenly get a client that desperately needs to communicate with the youth of today, I guess I'll have to suck it up and use them.</p>
<p>I may have to jab a pair of scissors beneath my kneecap while I use them, but I'll use them. (And if I were fifteen, I might tack an <i>LOL</i> on the end of that last sentence.)</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1408%1,1416%2","","","","omg_the_oed_has_driven_a_stake_through_my_3_lol","Personality storytelling OED copywriting audience","","",

Simple Excel tips for metrics nerds","","1055","","<p>Let’s get one thing out of the way first: This is a post about Excel tricks, but I am by no means an Excel whiz. Quite the contrary—while I love, love, love, mucking around in online metrics (sing to me, response rates!), I have nearly always done so with a minimum of Excel wizardry.</p>
<p>But this January’s reporting may have taken me to the next level of spreadsheet geekery. As I finished up some year-end analysis, I ran across a few tips that—while they might make a true pro yawn—<i>totally blew my mind</i>.</p>","<p>Let’s get one thing out of the way first: This is a post about Excel tricks, but I am by no means an Excel whiz. Quite the contrary—while I love, love, love, mucking around in online metrics (sing to me, response rates!), I have nearly always done so with a minimum of Excel wizardry.</p>
<p>But this January’s reporting may have taken me to the next level of spreadsheet geekery. As I finished up some year-end analysis, I ran across a few tips that—while they might make a true pro yawn—<i>totally blew my mind</i>.</p>
<p>So, because Excel beginners deserve kick-ass metrics too, I’m sharing a few tips I found particularly helpful:</p>
<p><b>Tip 1—Minimizing data entry by pulling from other sheets.</b></p>
<p>This is so easy it’s embarrassing. Refer to data on any other sheet in your Excel document by putting an equals sign in the destination cell, and then going to the sheet you want it to pull from, selecting the cell, and hitting return. Oh, the hours I’ve wasted copy and pasting data across sheets before now!</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Solution: This year I limited my metrics data entry to my message by message breakdown of email response metrics, and set up the formulas so that nearly all other analysis (benchmark comparisons, past-year comparisons, etc.) automatically populated on other tabs in my report.</p>
<p><br /><b>Tip 2—Uploading weirdly formatted lists of names into your database.</b></p>
<p>This gets the prize for the most bizarre Excel problem I’ve tackled, but I was so excited to have conquered it, I’m sharing it anyway. In the past, the “Data &gt; Text to Columns” feature always helped me format large files of supporter data so they could easily uploaded into a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system like Convio or Salsa. But when a client received the names of supporters not only in all caps, but <i>also</i> with the middle initial stuck onto the first name (Ex: “RACHELH ALLISON”) I was stumped.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Solution: To erase the middle initial no matter how long the first name, use this formula to refer to the original first-middle name cell: =LEFT<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">(A1</span>,LEN<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">(A1)</span>-1<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">)</span> And how to get rid of the caps problem? Refer to the all-caps name cell with: =PROPER<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">(D1)</span> Magic!</p>
<p><b>Tip 3—Putting metrics in context.</b></p>
<p>Here at Big Duck, we typically measure how a campaign fared to the previous year’s efforts, as well as how it compared to industry benchmarks. So how do you make those comparisons automatic <i>and</i> easy to scan visually?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Solution: The formula for comparison is a snap (=<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">This year’s data</span>/<span style=""color: #808000;"">Last year’s data</span>-100%, or = <span style=""color: #0000ff;"">your data</span>/<span style=""color: #808000;"">benchmark</span>-100%) and by using conditional formatting (Format &gt; Conditional Formatting…) to make percentages greater than zero display in green and percentages less than zero display in red, each metric comparison is made easier to scan visually.</p>
<p><b>Tip 4—Copying tables of data from HTML.</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, I’ll run a report in Convio and it will display on screen as a lovely table. But when I try to copy this table into Excel—not even “Text to Table” can sort the pasted cells into the right order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Solution: Credit goes to Farra for this one. When HTML tables won’t go directly into Excel, try Word. Select, copy, and paste the HTML table into Word, then under the “Table” menu, select “Convert &gt; Text to Table” Then indicate the original number of columns and voila! It should display in a table. And unlike the HTML table, your Word table <i>should </i>paste correctly into Excel.</p>
<p><b>Tip 5 - Looking smart in front of colleagues.</b><br /> As I said before, I am no Excel whiz. But I get so excited about spreadsheet formulas that sometimes people think I’ll know answers to their questions anyway. Silly Ducks, my knowledge comes from a higher source than actual k…</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">- Solution: Ask Google. Seriously. If there’s one thing more automagic than Excel, it’s Google. Just type your Excel question into the search bar and almost certainly you’ll find the answer pretty quickly on one of the bijillions of Excel forums out there. (Just last week I found the formula to find the highest and lowest values in a series this way. Thanks, internet!)</p>
<p>Again, as a self-confessed Excel beginner—these tricks may be low-level, but they’ve reinforced just how powerful even simple office tools can be in analyzing your campaign’s performance.</p>

<p><b>Process:</b><br /> How does your process work? How long have you been doing it this way? What kinds of things can go wrong in this process and how do you manage when things go wrong?</p>
<p><b>Fees:</b><br /> What does it cost to work with you? How do you arrive at your fees? If your fees are based on the time a project takes, how do you estimate and track your time? How do changes in scope or timing impact your prices? Do you recieve referral fees from partners or others you might recommend to me along the way?</p>
<p><b>Team:</b><br /> Who will I work with if I hire you? Am I working with a team or an individual, chiefly? How experienced are the people I'll be working with?</p>
<p><b>Timing:</b><br /> How much time do you think it takes to do this work right? What are the variables that can impact timing?</p>
<p><b>Project management:</b><br /> What will I need to do to keep this project on track and help ensure its success? How will you help me stay on track?</p>
<p>Asking these questions early helps you make a list of well-qualified candidates, so the batch of proposals you'll get back from them will be worth your time and consideration. The best, most qualified recipients (who are likely busy) are also more likely to respond if they've already spoken to you and perceive themselves to be on a 'short list', too.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/ntc-2011-logo.png"" style=""width: 372px; height: 310px;"" /></p>
<p>Couldn't make it to the NTC? Here are some thoughts and tips that emerged in our sessions and conversations that can help you bring your nonprofit's communications up to speed with emerging technology.</p>
<h3><!--break--><b>Listen to your data.</b></h3>
<p>Your online presence generates lots of data.&nbsp;Every day, your supporters are telling you what they think with their clicks--in their inboxes, online, on their mobile phones. Are you listening to what they're saying?</p>
<p>Just collecting your data isn't quite enough. Sorting lists and generating reports does not equal analysis, as Jeff Shuck of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.event360.com/"" target=""_blank"">Event 360</a> reminded us in his session on segmentation. And analysis doesn't equal improvement, unless you actually make changes in response to what you find.</p>
<p>It's easier if you don't try to do it all alone. Open up your data to others in your organization--let them poke around in your analytics, empower them to understand what they're looking at, and encourage them to seek data that can inform new ideas and initiatives.</p>
<h3><b>Decide who owns the tweets.</b></h3>
<p>We Ducks have been getting lots of questions lately about the best way to staff and assign responsibilities for nonprofit tech, and it came up a lot at the NTC. What department does emerging technology belong to? What about text messages?&nbsp;Data analysis?</p>
<p>In part, it depends on how your organization uses these tools, so keep an open mind. Encourage conversation in your organization about where new responsibilities belong, push to make sure they're formally included in someone's job description, and keep checking in to make sure they're assigned to the right department.</p>
<h3><b>TEST.</b></h3>
<p>Testing is a key best practice when it comes to online communications, but lots of nonprofits haven't really factored it into their plans yet.</p>
<p>By testing, we mean trying different variations of your online communications--whether it's your donation forms or your landing pages or your emails--and seeing which version gets the best response. There's plenty of conventional wisdom and speculation out there about what works, but you never know what's right for your organization until you test.</p>
<p>Testing can be a big proposition--according to Robin Steffek at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.redenginedigital.com/"" target=""_blank"">RedEngine Digital</a>, certain kinds of test require in-house IT staff to implement. But there's also a lot you can do on your own if you...</p>
<h3><b>Start slow.</b></h3>
<p><a href=""http://heathbrothers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Heath, co-author of&nbsp;<i>Switch</i></a>, gave a thought-provoking keynote about making change accessible by taking small steps that add up to big progress. It works at all levels, from fighting poverty to crafting an effective email campaign--even simple changes can help you make huge improvements in your online communications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next time you send an email, try a different style of subject line, or change the sender's name. Do your open and click-through rates change as a result?</li>
<li>Dip your toe into email segmentation by sending two versions of your next appeal--one to previous donors, and one to non-donors. Does it generate more revenue than your one-size-fits-all message from last year?</li>
<li>As you're preparing for your next campaign, make a simple variation to your online donation or signup form--say, one with a compelling photograph, and one without--and use a tool like&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer"" target=""_blank"">Google Website Optimizer</a> or&nbsp;<a href=""http://optimizely.appspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Optimizely</a> to display different versions at random to your visitors. Over time, which one has the highest response and conversion rates?</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Revisit the basics.</b></h3>
<p>There's a lot of exciting technology out there--""Let's start following all our donors on Foursquare!""--but most nonprofits would benefit from taking a step back and considering the basics--like creating a website that's easy to find and navigate, and making sure you send a last-chance fundraising email on December 31.</p>
<h3><b>It keeps going and going and...</b></h3>
<p>We don't need to tell you how fast the online world is changing. Just keeping up with emerging best practices can be a huge project. Take your website, for example. You want your site to look beautiful; be easily navigable; have great, meaningful content that's easy to digest; appear in search engines; be accessible for all visitors, but specific to the interests of each--and those are just the sessions we attended Friday morning.</p>
<p>It's daunting, we know. But don't give up. Think of your organization's online communications as a perpetual work in progress, keep chipping away, and go to the NTC for ideas and inspiration!</p>

<p><b>1. Flipping the switch</b>--When you update all core materials at once, and the new identity is announced and unveiled at a major event or gathering of key members of your community.</p>
<p><b>2. Phased launch</b>--When you update core materials in phases (usually print materials first, then online, etc.), announcing the change at an event or with an informal announcement to stakeholders, and completing the shift within a year.</p>
<p><b>3. Rolling launch</b>--When you update old materials as they run out, and you update the major public-facing expressions of your brand, like your website, as time and budget allow.</p>
<p>So which type of roll out is best? While ""flipping the switch"" has typically been the most successful in our experience, <b>the best brand roll out strategies always take into account the complexity of the brand shift, the organization's time, resources, and any anticipated resistance or confusion.</b></p>
<p>A great example of this was the brandraising rollout by our client, <a href=""http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/"" target=""_parent"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>. When the staff and board came to Big Duck, their organization was named Colorectal Cancer Coalition. They were passionate, smart, and growing, but their current brand was often misunderstood (""No, we weren't 'Katie's group.'""). When our brandraising process culminated in an energetic, fiesty new brand--complete with a new name--the team knew they would have to handle the rollout with care.</p>
<p>In the end, Fight Colorectal Cancer decided to ""flip the switch"" at their annual Call-on Congress advocacy day--an event that perfectly captured the active, grassroots energy expressed by the new identity. They also set the stage for rollout success for the day by previewing the new brand to key community members and giving them a t-shirt with the new brand when they arrived in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>By all accounts the rollout has gone very well, and Judi Sohn, Vice President of Operations,&nbsp;<a href=""http://judisohn.com/fight-colorectal-cancer-a-rebranding-tale"" target=""_blank"">shared some great tips and lessons learned in a recent post on her blog</a>.</p>

As in, ""you actually work in a place called Big Duck?"" In fact, I remember the first time my father-in-law needed to send something to the office, and he heard our agency name for the first time. I believe his exact words were ""that's the name of your company?"" And then he chuckled.</p>
<p></p>","<p>One of the things that I enjoy about telling people where I work is the ability to say the words ""Big Duck."" As in, ""you actually work in a place called Big Duck?"" In fact, I remember the first time my father-in-law needed to send something to the office, and he heard our agency name for the first time. I believe his exact words were ""that's the name of your company?"" And then he chuckled.</p>
<p>For the past year, we'd been having many discussions internally about taking a fresh look at our own brand and perhaps, making a few changes. Not change for change's sake, mind you, but a deliberate, planned-out, set of things we all felt was appropriate as Big Duck has grown and evolved. The only thing we knew for certain was, we're sticking with the name ""Big Duck"" (my father-in-law isn't the only person who likes it, and hey, it still works).</p>
<p>It's always a challenge to be objective with one's own work, so we tackled that by treating ourselves as our own clients. We started with a <a href=""/brandraising/assessment"">brandraising assessment</a>, conducted interviews with both internal and external audiences, did our research, and before long, we set out to execute the plan that emerged. The end result of all of our homework was that we all (and that includes you) still love the ducks and how we dress, although some of us insiders felt a touch up might be valuable. So we set about freshening up our visual identity in a way that didn't lose who we were, but rather, reflected what we've become, and what we will be, going forward. We'd be lying to you if we said this process was easy, especially while going about our regular daily work with our <a href=""/clients"">nonprofit clients</a>. But I'm proud to say that we're well on our way.</p>
<p>You may have already noticed some of our changes, or maybe not (they're pretty subtle). Regardless, we thought it would be nice to share some of the process with you. (I warn you, you won't get the full breadth of the range of the changes in one blogpost, perhaps we'll leave that for another day.)</p>
<p>First, would it surprise you to hear that our official Big Duck primary logo is the typographical one (and not the duck mark). The refreshed Big Duck primary logo didn't actually change too much. Why? Because the weight, colors and ""feel"" were still true to our organization's personality. So we took the opportunity to do a little cleanup, and tweak those things that we've been meaning to adjust.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8007fd4de643842ed66fa98199f06638/files/_6.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""360"" /></p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Ok, the change is subtle, but important to us on the design team. We're crazy that way.</p>
<p>We did explore other options, but we decided the original concept was still the best. But here were some initial sketches.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8007fd4de643842ed66fa98199f06638/files/_5.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""306"" /><br /><small>Refreshing, but still, seemed oddly familiar. </small></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8007fd4de643842ed66fa98199f06638/files/_4.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""306"" /></p>
<p><small>Close, but we're not nearly that sexy.</small></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8007fd4de643842ed66fa98199f06638/files/_3.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""306"" /><br /><small>Too soon?</small></p>
<p>Well, you can see why we stuck with our original. Plus if we completely dumped who we were, and lost our duckiness, well, we bet that we'd get a lot of angry emails. Not to mention, it'd be a real departure from our <a href=""/resources/scorecard/glossary#Positioning"">positioning</a>.</p>
<p>But lest you think this process was too subtle of a rebrand, check out our revamped duck!</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/8007fd4de643842ed66fa98199f06638/files/_2.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""360"" /><br /><small>TaDa!</small></p>
<p>Don't see it?</p>

<p><small>The devil is in the details.</small></p>
<p>Obviously, there's much more in the Big Duck visual rebrand that will stem from the work tweaking our secondary logo, including some rather kickass print and online materials, as well as a brand-spanking new website coming soon.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

Good for you--we can tell it's going to be awesome (like <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/"">Big Duck's oh-so-shiny new site</a>!).</p>
<p>You already know that every good site needs clear and measurable goals, a strong set of tools and systems for keeping it up to date, and regular review and analysis to make sure it's performing optimally.</p>
<p>But what makes the difference between a smooth, successful process, and one that leaves you tearing your hair out?</p>
<p>Fret not--we've got some thoughts (seven, to be precise) to help you along the way.</p>
<p><strong>1. Set a reasonable and flexible calendar.</strong><br /> It takes between six and ten months to create a new website, from your first meeting to the day of launch. That might sound like a long time, but believe us, it goes by fast.</p>
<p>Give your team enough time to do it and do it right, and be ready to roll with the punches when someone comes up with an interesting new idea or your users give you some unexpected feedback.</p>
<p>And to that point...</p>
<p><strong>2. Start writing early.</strong><br /> <a href=""/contentmgr/blog/unsung-hero-stellar-website"">Rewriting the content for your website</a> can be hands-down the most time-consuming and complicated part of the process. We've seen many a website launch pushed back weeks or months to allow more time for writing.</p>
<p>To avoid delays, assign a writer, editor, and proofreader for each page as soon as you have an approved site map, and provide all your writers with guidelines about tone, content, word counts, and any other resources they need to write efficiently and well.</p>
<p><strong>3. Get feedback from your users.</strong><br /> This website isn't for you--it's for the people you are trying to reach, so include your community in the process as much as you can. User testing can be complicated and expensive, but here are some simple things you can do without breaking the bank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a survey to your email list and Facebook fans asking them what they want from your website.</li>
<li>Call up a few supporters for some on-the-spot feedback to your site map or initial designs.</li>
<li>Write profiles of sample audience members to remind yourself of what they're looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be surprised what you find--even a little outside perspective can go a long way.</p>
<p><strong>4. Leave plenty of time for review.</strong><br /> It's tempting to launch your site the minute you paste the last paragraph into the content management system. But pause. Take a deep breath. Before you hit ""go,"" give yourselves a few weeks to test-drive (also known as a ""soft launch"") your fully developed site before it goes live.<br /><br /> Review the whole site page by page--are there any egregious errors or typos? Do any of the pages look weird? Is all of the content written in your organization's voice/personality? Have you chosen the right images? Do all of the links work?</p>
<p>You've been working on this site for months--make sure there's not a pixel out of place when you finally show it to the world.</p>
<p><strong>5. Create an editorial calendar to keep the site fresh.<br /> </strong>It's all too easy for a great new website to go stale if you can't maintain momentum after launch. Help yourself stay on top of things (online, at least) with a detailed editorial calendar.</p>
<p>Go through your website and flag all the content that needs to be updated regularly--daily, weekly, monthly, and so on. Make a comprehensive list, and then block time on your calendar to make sure it happens.</p>
<p><strong>6. Plan a six-month checkup.</strong><br /> No matter how carefully you plan or how thoroughly you review, you will come across things on your new website that you wish you could change once it's live.</p>
<p>Keep a running list of anything that bugs you or any features that you don't think are working out quite the way you'd hoped, and ask your team to do the same. Six months after launch, get together and review your lists to figure out what you can do to make your excellent new website even better. You might even bring in a few users to test key tasks and actions.</p>
<p><strong>7. Be prepared to do it all again in three years or so.</strong><br /> The online world changes rapidly (remember MySpace?), and most organizations we work with find that they need to plan for a significant website update about once every three years in order to keep pace with best practices and shifts in user expectations.</p>
<p>But don't despair--conducting regular reviews and making improvements as you go can help you stay in good shape to tackle the bigger changes when the time comes. And besides, now that you know how to conduct a smart website development process, it should be easy, right?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1","","","","seven_tips_for_managing_a_smart_website_process","Online Experiential-communications website-launch rebrand Big-Duck-website","","",

And working with smart people is fun.</p>
<p>But working with smart people isn't <em>just</em> fun. The collaboration also makes our work for clients better. That's one reason nonprofits hire us.</p>
<p>Not every nonprofit can work with us, nor can we work with every nonprofit, as much as we may like to. So if you're working with freelancers instead of an agency, how can you simulate that collaborative advantage?</p>
<p>Well, let me talk a little bit about me (and <a href=""/about/team"" target=""_blank"">my fellow Ducks</a>), by way of example. We've got pretty clearly defined roles here. For anything we do, I'm in charge of the words. <a href=""/about/team/sonny_mui"" target=""_blank"">Sonny</a>, our Design Director, as his title suggests, is in charge of the visuals. I don't design things for him, and he doesn't write things for me.</p>
<p>But he and I have worked together a long time now (we met at a corporate agency years ago). During that time, we've gotten pretty comfortable sharing ideas with each other. I'm not so ""turfy"" that I can't admit that Sonny has come up with some pretty good lines. And some of the concepts I've come up with have been driven by visuals.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's necessary for us to go off on our own and really hash out the parts we do best. Sonny tries to make everything look stunning; I try to make it sound good.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's say you've got an annual report to create, and you hire freelancers to write and/or design it. Encourage the writer and designer to work together (even if one of you is on the staff at your organization). Have them collaborate to create an overarching concept for the report and discuss how that concept will play out visually and verbally. Just getting your words and visuals working together will improve your annual report tenfold and help it stand above the other annual reports in the world.</p>
<p>Extend that collaboration across any of the work you've hired freelancers for. Many a successful logo we've designed at Big Duck has been inspired by the tagline. And often, when I've been most stuck writing a tagline, a simple turn to the visual work helps me break through to the other side.</p>
<p>So if you're investing in freelancers, get more brain for your buck by having them collaborate.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1","","","","good_brain_for_the_buck","Identity Experiential-communications freelancers collaboration","","",

So we're devoting this month's Duck Pond to three basic, low-tech tools that will help you communicate better than any fancy apps you've got on your mobile device.<br /><br /> <strong>1. The auto-responder.</strong><br /> Going on vacation? Offline while traveling, or in meetings? Don't forget to set up an auto-responder that lets people know that you're out, when you'll be back, and whom to contact in your absence. Too often this simple step gets overlooked, but it's a powerful way to help your donors, colleagues, partners, and the media feel they're getting what they need from you. Don't be afraid to use your auto-responder for everyday work-related absences or events, not just vacation. Letting people know that your gala is next week so you're responding slowly to email this week or offline entirely can be extremely helpful, for instance. Setting them up is easy. If you don't know how, ask the person who helps with your IT.<br /><br /> Here's a draft we encourage you to take and make your own:</p>
<blockquote style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;""><i>Subject: Auto-responder/I'm out<br /><br /> Hello! I'm offline until (date) working/vacationing/watching reality television shows. During that time, I'll be checking email less frequently than usual. Please contact XX at (phone/email) if you need something immediately. Otherwise, I'll be back and likely to respond to your email the week of XX.<br /><br /> (your email signature)</i></blockquote>
<p>Injecting a little humor in your auto-responder often gets people to pay closer attention, too. Give it a try!</p>
<p><strong>2. The email signature.</strong><br />At its simplest, a good email signature helps ensure that folks you want to reach have your correct name, title, organization, and contact information and saves them time tracking down your phone number.</p>
<p>But an email signature can also be a great way to promote your organization's online presence. Here's an example of what we Ducks use:<br /><br /><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;""> <span style=""color: #828282;""> ........................................................................................</span><br /> Sarah Durham | Principal<br /><br /> Big Duck | Smart Communications for Nonprofits<br /> t 718 237 9551 ext 12 m 718 344 6027<br /> <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/"" style=""color: #00b2bc; font-size: 11px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #00b2bc;"">www.bigducknyc.com</span></a><br /><br /> <span style=""color: #828282;""> ........................................................................................</span><br /> Join me: <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog"" style=""color: #00b2bc; font-size: 11px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #00b2bc;"">Blog</span></a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/bigducksarah"" style=""color: #00b2bc; font-size: 11px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #00b2bc;"">Twitter</span></a> | <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bigducksarah"" style=""color: #00b2bc; font-size: 11px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #00b2bc;"">LinkedIn</span></a> | AIM: bigducksarah<br /> <span style=""color: #828282;""> ........................................................................................</span><br /> </span></p>
<p>We prefer a mix of links to help you stay in touch with us individually (LinkedIn, AIM) and to connect people with Big Duck (blog, website). Be sure to stay professional: don't link to your personal Facebook profile unless you really want all of your work contacts to friend you.</p>
<p>Try using a standard typeface common on most computers (Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman, for instance) at a specific size and perhaps a color that relates well to your organization's visual identity. Better yet, ask the person in charge of your organization's brand to set up a standard email signature everyone can use so it feels consistent. Avoid using your logo or other elements as attached JPEG files--they often get filtered out on the recipient's end and can create other problems.</p>
<p>Setting up email signatures is simple in most email programs--look through your ""Preferences"" menu, or ask your IT person to teach you to set one up.</p>
<p><strong>3. Your voice</strong><br />Email rocks, but there are times when the phone or face-to-face is simply the smarter way to communicate. Here are two key situations when you should really pick up the phone or get together instead of hitting ""reply"":</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When the message involves bad news or negative information.</em><br />Bad news is best expressed and delivered in a more personal way, so that you can help the recipient understand and process it. Don't email your program person that the funding for their favorite program just got cut--pick up the phone and call them, or better yet, walk down the hall and meet with them about it face-to-face.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>When the implications are complex or very subtle.</em><br />Irony and complicated ideas are often missed in email. If what you're communicating really needs to be understood thoroughly, talk about it first. Then use email as a written reminder of what you've discussed.</li>

Money's tight, time's limited, and so decisions are made quickly (and sometimes foolishly) about what the organization's name and tagline should be, how the logo should look, etc.</p>
<p>At some point downstream, maybe five or ten years later, you've got a staff, an engaged board, even a water cooler and a fancy machine that makes lattes in the office. But still, that fly-by-night brand hangs on... and people start grumbling.</p>
<p>""I don't know how to talk about our work well enough to ask other people to support it"", says the board member. ""This stuff doesn't really look good on the materials we need to produce,"" says the designer. ""Oy!"" you say. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the nail in the coffin of your accidental brand is, almost always, your website.</p>
<p>Because sooner or later, you've got to update that built--at-the-dawn-of-the-last-century-website. And when you do, all those same questions about how you talk about and show your work will come bubbling up.</p>
<p>While most people tend to think 'logo' or even 'visuals' when they hear the word 'brand', we Ducks argue that messaging is just as important. And clear messaging should be the backbone of your website.</p>
<p>An organization without clear messaging tends to default to the standard types of navigation areas: <em>about us, programs, contact, services, who we are, donate</em>. This organization-centric navigation is useful if you know what a 'service' is. But what if you don't?</p>
<p>A good messaging process forces you to think about the big idea you want people to associate with your organization, and the messages you need to communicate to them so they'll get it. What is the action you want them to take? And what's in it for them?</p>
<p>That platform serves as a great basis for building a website.</p>
<p>The navigation for the <a href=""http://www.nyccharterschools.org/"" target=""_blank"">New York City Charter School Center's website</a> reads: <em>&nbsp;learn, lead, act, meet</em>. These are engaging action verbs that lead the visitor down a path that's results-oriented.</p>
<p>Similarly, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy's website navigation reads, <em>Understand Duchenne, Care for Him, Advance Research, Advocate, Connect, Fundraise</em>.</p>
<p>And yes, the logo, colors, and use of images must be engaging too.</p>
<p>Without resolving those branding issues first, you'll likely build a new website with all the same old communications problems. Instead, build into your timeline and budget what you need to fix the branding issues first- then tackle the website. Not sure how to do that?

<p>Okay, maybe I'm being a little dramatic. Starting a Facebook Page can be a great way to dive into social media. And now that <a href=""http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/more-than-half-the-us-population-now-on-facebook-14219/"">over half of Americans are Facebooking away</a>, odds are good that at least part of your audience is there waiting for you.</p>

<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1fbb8feda0622e0d59e1ce54e21e6648/files/n41130665917_1854168_2197.jpg"" width=""360"" height=""163"" /></p>
<p>So I've changed my mind--go ahead and start a Facebook Page. But please, before you do...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get comfortable</strong>. Facebook works in mysterious ways, but creating an account for yourself, connecting with a few of your friends, and liking some Pages can help you get the lay of the land. And if you're the type who likes to read all the instructions before you play the game, there's also a comprehensive Help Center with a <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/help/?guide"">guide to getting started</a> and a special <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nonprofits?sk=app_149255468478339"" target=""_blank"">Page of resources for nonprofits</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Set goals</strong>. Why are you creating a Page? ""Because everybody's got one"" isn't a good enough answer. Figure out what Facebook means to your organization's communications strategy, and why you want people to connect with you there. Then invite, promote, and create content in ways that help you reach your goals.</li>
<li><strong>Make time</strong>. Facebook isn't magic. Like any tool, it doesn't do the work for you--the results you see are proportional to the time you invest. Most nonprofits need to spend at least two hours a week posting, responding, measuring, and growing.</li>
<li><strong>Stay cool</strong>. It's all too easy to overshare on Facebook. If you post too often, your likers will feel spammed, and they'll hide your updates. So start slow--limit yourself to one post per day, encourage responses by including a question or call to action in each post, and see what happens. If your likers are loving it, you can start stepping up the volume.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate</strong>. Your Facebook community shouldn't be a world unto itself. Promote your Page on other materials--websites, emails, brochures--and vice versa, and make sure your Facebooking supports and reinforces your other communications.</li>
<li><strong>Have patience</strong>. Don't get discouraged if you're not getting an immediate response or rapid growth in your first weeks and months on Facebook. It takes getting used to, both for your organization and for your audience. Try new things--different types of posts, different times of day, different frequency--and keep an eye out for small successes that you can build on.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if all this Facebook stuff doesn't align with your nonprofit's values or support your communications goals, don't start a Page. Really. It's okay. Facebook is one tool among many--powerful, yes, and popular, but that doesn't mean it's the right fit for every nonprofit.</p>
<p>If you're on Facebook, what would you recommend to a newcomer to help her get started? If you haven't taken the Facebook plunge yet, what's holding you back?

An incredible nonprofit with a mind-blowing mission comes to us, eager to create a snazzy new website or fundraising piece. We get to the part where we ask what they've got by way of photos and discover...not much. Sure, stock images are okay for some things (particularly <a href=""http://thehairpin.com/2011/01/women-laughing-alone-with-salad"" target=""_blank"">women laughing alone with salad</a>), but there's just no substitute for real photos that bring your programs to life.</p>
<p>Now, we realize that not everybody has the money to set up a professional photo shoot, but there's plenty of opportunity for you to take high-quality photos yourself. Here are 10 tips we've put together to help you do it:<br /><br /> <strong>1. Think beyond events.</strong> Sure, everyone's all smiles at your annual benefit, but it's your day-to-day programs that convey what you're really about. The most powerful and inspiring photos are the ones that provide a window into the work you do and the people you help. So lose the sequined gown and plan a trip to your program sites instead.<br /><br /> <strong>2. Be prepared...but not too prepared. </strong>You don't want to catch anyone off guard (or, heaven forbid, on a bad hair day), so let the people you're photographing know what day you'll be coming. Just make sure they know not to dress up or do anything out of the ordinary.<br /><br /> <strong>3. Don't say cheese. </strong>For most people, it's reflex to smile for the camera. But candid photos are often more effective for showing the interactions and emotions at the heart of your work. Tell the people you're photographing that you just want them to keep doing what they'd normally do, and not pay attention to the camera. This way, you'll get a more honest and realistic view of things.<br /><br /> <strong>4. Consider the details. </strong>As much as you want your photos to be realistic, reality isn't always pretty. So as the photographer you'll need to think a little about composing your shots. Is there an awkward void in the middle of your frame or something distracting going on in the background? You may need to spruce up the setting or try shooting from another angle. Pay attention to the lighting and try to avoid backlit subjects or weird shadows. And if you know you aren't allowed to show hats or items with logos in your final photos, ask people to remove them.<br /><br /> <strong>5. Get close.</strong> Instead of trying to capture a whole scene a single photo, try focusing in on specific people or interactions. While you may lose a little context, images that clearly capture faces and expressions are generally more compelling. Details of hands or close-ups of objects related to your work can also be nicely evocative, so think creatively.<br /><br /> <strong>6. Shoot lots of frames. </strong>Remember when cameras had film that cost money to develop? Well, those days are gone and in the age of digital there's no reason you shouldn't go crazy, snapping away as fast as your fingers can go. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is spending a lot of time trying to set up that one perfect shot. Instead, take ten and you can sort out the duds later.<br /><br /> <strong>7. Embrace color. </strong>Make sure your camera's always set to shoot in color. It's a simple Photoshop fix to convert color photos to black-and-white, but pretty much impossible to do the other way around. Similarly, leave any experiments with special filters or effects for post-production.<br /><br /> <strong>8. Use high resolution. </strong>Resolution refers to the number of little dots or pixels that make up a photographic image. The higher the resolution, the larger you can use the image with it still looking crisp. Sadly, clients sometimes send us nicely composed photos, but the resolution is so low that they're virtually unusable. The solution? First, use an actual camera--not your phone--and, second, always set it to high resolution. Most digital cameras have a <em>superfine</em> setting, which will give you the best quality and the most flexibility for your photos.<br /><br /> <strong>9. Always get permission. </strong>Legally, you need signed model releases from everyone in your photos before you can use them on your materials. It's best to get permission before the shoot rather than after. This way, if it turns out someone's not comfortable with you using their image, you can simply leave them out of your photos.<br /><br /><strong> 10. Take your camera everywhere.</strong> If you pay attention, there are opportunities to take great pictures all the time. And the more you take, the more your designers will have to work with. Plus, photo documentation of your programs can come in handy beyond communications pieces: photos are often an integral part of grant proposals, they can be turned into projected slideshows for donor events, or even become great artwork to hang in your office.</p>

It also helps you do so more quickly.</p>
<p>This suggestion requires that you take a step back. It also requires an investment in time and resources up front. But it pays off in the long run.</p>
<p>Let's assume you have clarity about your <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard/glossary#Personality"" target=""_blank"">positioning and personality</a>. (If you struggle with those things, you'll need to take another step back. And if you're not sure what they are, Sarah's book <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising"" target=""_blank""><em>Brandraising</em></a> can help.)</p>
<p>What if you have clarity about those things, but it's still difficult to talk about your work because your programs are varied or your issue is complicated?</p>
<p>You probably need to formally define some key messages for your organization, which, frankly, can require a lot of work. But it's doable.</p>
<p>More than anything this is an organizing effort. You're figuring out how to reframe the discussion in the terms most beneficial to your organization (and in terms your audiences understand).</p>
<p>Start by writing down the primary points about the issue you're addressing and then also about the work you do to tackle the issue. You'll want to jot things down about your outcomes and perhaps your history, and anything else that seems relevant.</p>
<p>Next, take a look at everything you've written down from a ""big picture"" point-of-view. And then create an outline of the big ideas around your work. Think of the outline as a ""highlights reel"" for your organization, written with sentences that can be used verbatim or as a jumping off point for a more in-depth discussion.</p>
<p>The organized outline that frames your issue and your work can serve as your key messages.</p>
<p>If you're feeling ambitious, you can even add your key messages to a ""master messaging document."" It's like a style guide for your whole messaging platform. Your messaging document will include your positioning, personality, vision statement, mission statement, values statement, and key messages in a document you can share with everyone in your organization.</p>
<p>An outside consultant, agency, strategist, or copywriter can be immensely helpful for this process. (It is--ahem--<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising/messaging"" target=""_blank"">something we do here at Big Duck</a>.) It's difficult writing about something you're too close to, especially when you're trying to get a fresh, broad perspective on everything.</p>
<p>This process isn't easy. But once it's done, you'll have all of the big ideas behind your nonprofit in one handy document.</p>
<p>Magic! No more daunting blank page. You always have a place to start, no matter what you're writing. You'll be amazed not only at how much more easily you can write about your work with fewer words, but also at how much more quickly the writing process goes.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1,1408%2,1066%3,1409%4","","","","avoid_the_daunting_blank_page","Positioning Personality Brandraising messaging key-messages","","",

Great because it keeps things interesting and (hopefully) helps you connect with your audiences in new and deeper ways. Frustrating because keeping up with best practices and new tactics can feel exhausting, particularly when you're already pressed for time and budget.</p>
<p>Understanding how other nonprofits develop their online engagement strategy and manage their online presence can often help though.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I recently sat in on a my colleague,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.newschool.edu/milano/courses.aspx?id=37551"">Farra Trompeter's Online Engagement class</a>&nbsp;at Milano, the New School for Management and Urban Policy.&nbsp; At the session I attended, Farra brought in four smart nonprofit online marketing and communications managers to share how their organizations engage people online. Kyra Stoddart from&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amnestyusa.org/"">Amnesty International USA</a>, Daniel Buckley from&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.foodbanknyc.org/"">Food Bank for New York City</a>, Danielle Brigida from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://nwf.org/"">National Wildlife Federation</a>, and Johannes Neuer from&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nypl.org/"">The New York Public Library</a>, all develop online engagement strategies for their organizations and do the hard work of using the tools day in and day out. Here are some of the key lessons I took from the great insights they all shared:</p>
<p><strong>Old Favorites</strong></p>
<p>You've probably heard these before (I know I have), but, for me, they're always worth reiterating:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with your mission and with clear goals.</strong><br />Each presenter started by stating his or her organization's mission and online engagement objectives. A great reminder that, no matter how much potential a new online channel, tool, or feature seems to have, how you approach it and what you do with it (if anything) should always start with understanding how it relates to your organization's mission and broader goals.</li>
<li><strong>Don't neglect email or your website.</strong><br />Even though nonprofit social media&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.theagitator.net/media-usage/nonprofits-growing-use-of-social-media/"">usage is growing</a>, websites and email are still at the heart of online engagement. Each of the speakers reminded everyone that they still see more action and traffic coming from their organization's website and emails than from other online engagement channels.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy for people to take action.</strong><br />Whether it's with a custom Facebook landing tab (like&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/foodbanknyc"">Food Bank for New York City's</a>, a carefully thought-out online form (like&nbsp;<a href=""http://takeaction.nypl.org/action"">The New York Public Library</a>&nbsp;use), or a campaign page that pulls actions together in one place, all of the organizations that presented take steps to make it easy for their supporters to take action and see great results.</li>
<li><strong>Learn by doing.</strong><br />Blog posts like this are all well and good, but the best way to learn about new tools is by using them. Danielle in particular advocates trying out social media tools in a small, low-key way to help figure out how they might be useful for reaching and engaging your organization's audiences.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Tricks</h4>
<p>As for new things I picked up from each of the presenters, these were the ideas that stood out most for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use an internal social network to help find content for external communications.</strong><br />Social media isn't just a tool for engaging your external audiences. You can also use it to engage staff, particularly if your organization is spread across lots of locations. The National Wildlife Federation, for example, uses&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.yammer.com/"">Yammer</a>&nbsp;to allow staff across the country to keep each other updated and connected about what's going on in their program or region. It also makes it quick and easy for staff who manage the organization's many social media profiles to find content and answer questions.</li>
<li><strong>Find new ways to connect the offline world with the online one.</strong><br />Each of the organizations that presented had found interesting ways to connect the real world with the online one. The New York Public Library, for example, uses signs and&nbsp;<a href=""http://mashable.com/tag/qr-codes/"">QR codes</a>&nbsp;in its physical locations to drive people to connect with it online.&nbsp;<a href=""https://foursquare.com/amnesty"">Amnesty International USA uses Foursquare</a>&nbsp;to expand its reach and educate supporters, by leaving&nbsp;<a href=""http://aboutfoursquare.com/what-is-a-tip/"">tips</a>&nbsp;at locations connected to the human rights movement. And&nbsp;<a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/foodbank4nyc]"">Food Bank for New York City uses Twitter</a>&nbsp;to involve individual donors in events that they wouldn't normally be able to participate in, like its annual gala.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Consider investing in a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/what-is-social-crm/"">social CRM</a><a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/what-is-social-crm/"">&nbsp;tool</a>&nbsp;to manage your online relationships. </strong><br />Since you invest so much time and effort in finding and cultivating your organization's friends, fans, likers, and followers, it may well make sense to invest in a tool that helps manage your relationships with them even better. The National Wildlife Federation uses&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.smallact.com/software-consulting/thrive/"">Small Act's Thrive</a>&nbsp;to identify influencers, understand supporter's interests, and tailor their communication with people based on that information.</li>
</ul>

It didn't matter if they weren't a part of the original discussion as they were the people who had time to read, edit, and approve whatever was written before it went out.</p>","<p>A decade ago, a typical nonprofit staff person with 'communications' in their job title would have spent much of their time writing press releases and facilitating media coverage.&nbsp; As things happened at the organization, a communications staff person was briefed so they could write something about it for the newsletter, annual report, etc, or pitch a story to a journalist. It didn't matter if they weren't a part of the original discussion as they were the people who had time to read, edit, and approve whatever was written before it went out.</p>
<p>As people become more actively engaged with your issues and work online, communicators have to be seamlessly embedded throughout the organization, and the broadcaster/writer/editor role is changing. Why? Because communicating effectively online, particularly in social media, requires a fluid, transparent exchange of information. When done well, a conversation emerges that builds relationships with advocates, friends, and maybe even donors. An organization that issues press releases and doesn't engage in conversation online or encourage others to share opinions is perceived as 'broadcasting', or, worse, trying to control or avoid the conversation.</p>
<p>Pitching stories to the media just ain't what it used to be. Even landing big media coverage no longer reliably yields significant results. Donors don't mail in big checks because they read about you in the Wall Street Journal or saw your organization featured on CNN. So instead of focusing efforts on media relations, communications staff who understand today's world are seeking out content to blog, Tweet, and Facebook. Communicating with external audiences is often happening in real-time, or close to it, and they need to keep that conversation fresh and active. Perhaps the people who're communicating about your organization online need to be in those programs or advocacy meetings too--or, at least, briefed immediately afterwards--if they're going to be able to engage in online conversations about them.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking as communications as a separate department, nonprofits should start seeing everyone as a communicator, regardless of if it's in their job title or not. It's up to the program, development, and executive staffs to identify meaningful topics on the organization that should be shared externally and make sure it's handled well--otherwise that content gets lost, or can feel filtered and less engaged.</p>
<p>And instead of thinking of themselves as writers and editors, staff communicators should think of themselves as hunters and gatherers--seeking out good content, sharing it meaningfully, and sharing the spoils of that conversation both internally and externally.</p>

But we promise that it won't all be tantrums and potty-training.</p>
<p>Instead, we're going to look at a few highlights from the past year (you can find <a href=""/blog/one-year-duck-call-madness"" target=""_blank"">highlights from our first year here</a>). That way, we get to toot our own horn while also passing along to you some of the lessons we've learned. See? Our twos aren't so terrible.</p>
<p>Here are a few good things we did this past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tripling the number of pageviews</li>
<li>Increasing the annual number of blog posts by 50%</li>
<li>Redesigning our website to fully integrate the blog</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering how we've been able to do this, below are a few of strategies we use to keep our blog updated, fresh, and relevant.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We clearly define goals--</strong>Each year, Liz and I sit down to discuss our online and social media strategies and recommendations for the year. We consider our audiences, best practices in the field, and the time we can require of our fellow Ducks to create content. Then we establish a clear and realistic set of goals for the upcoming year and present it in a staff meeting for feedback and buy-in.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""2""><strong>We keep a blogging calendar</strong>--A calendar helps to organize the Ducks who want to write for the blog. We assign a different writer every week, and we keep a shared Google doc that the entire team can use with blog topics and resources. The calendar gives everyone plenty of advance notice before his or her article is due and allows for flexibility and a variety of subjects and voices on the blog.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""3""><strong>We establish a gatekeeper</strong>--I am the gatekeeper. Collecting posts and updating the blog is part of my job and integrated into my weekly routine. It takes away the confusion of roles and responsibilities, and eliminates the stress of chasing someone down for a post or scrambling last minute. Establishing a centralized system (with supportive backup and buy-in from everyone else) keeps the blog from getting ignored.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these strategies--along with smart, fun, and creative content--we are organized as a team to expand and grow the blog each year.</p>

<p>There are two important concepts that provide the foundation for all of your communications efforts: positioning and personality. <a href=""/resources/scorecard/glossary#Positioning"" target=""_blank"">Positioning</a> is big idea you want people to associate with you, and <a href=""/resources/scorecard/glossary#Personality"" target=""_blank"">personality</a> is the tone/style you use to communicate to guide how your audience experiences you.<br /><br /> We Ducks are often asked how <a href=""/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">brandraising</a> impacts fundraising, social media, and other types of day-to-day communications. So we thought we'd dedicate this issue of the Duck Pond to highlight a recent example.<br /><br /> At the end of April, <a href=""http://www.sco.org/home/sco-competes-for-500000-top-prize/"" target=""_blank"">SCO Family of Services</a> got an opportunity to dive into the deep end of the social media pool. They were one of five nonprofits selected to compete for up $500,000 to support their work with homeless and disconnected youth through an online voting contest sponsored by Lady Gaga and the Robin Hood Foundation.<br /><br /> As an essential provider of effective social services for New York City and Long Island, SCO Family of Services has traditionally prioritized direct service delivery over external communications. But they couldn't miss an opportunity like this.<br /><br /> <img alt=""SCO email"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/DuckPond/July2011/sco-email.jpg"" style=""width: 130px; height: 165px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 7px;"" />Because we previously worked with SCO to update its brand, they came back to Big Duck to figure out how to compete and win the contest. Over an intense two-week period, we used their personality traits--<i>vital</i>, <i>nurturing</i>, <i>expert</i>, and <i>trusted</i>--to guide the strategy, choose the right communications channels, <a href=""http://www.marknetmail.com/mx/display.php?M=88824&amp;C=2d96f6ac214a403595aca3e69fa0b5bf&amp;S=1773&amp;L=348&amp;N=1059"" target=""_blank"">craft the copy and design of messages</a>, update the website, and engage new fans and followers on Facebook and Twitter.<br /><br /> As their staff and board rallied friends to get out the vote, SCO was able to leverage what makes it unique in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a0bqvmsGRs"" target=""_blank"">the stories it shared</a>. On the flip side, when someone mentioned the idea of buying a print ad, we agreed that this decision would run counter to the organization's personality and its commitment to efficiency.<br /><br /> SCO ultimately won the contest with 40% of the one million votes cast, and they took home the big $500,000 prize.<br /><br /> How can personality guide the way you build relationships with your supporters? Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an organization wants to be a vocal thought leader on a particular issue, it might create a YouTube channel that presents videos of experts on topics related to its mission.</li>
<li>If an organization is nurturing and inspiring, their blog might feature stories of people being helped or helping others.</li>
<li>If an organization is assertive and bold, it may use its Facebook page to ask provocative questions and encourage spirited conversations among its fans.</li>

<li>Are social media sites also sucking people away from spending time on websites? According to data released by Google Analytics, on average, <a href=""http://newslettermail.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-analytics-benchmarking.html"" target=""_blank"">people are spending less time on websites now than they were two years ago</a>. How do your website's stats compare?</li>
<li>If you've spent much time around teenagers and suspected that they'd rather text people than talk to them, your suspicions are partly correct: <a href=""http://blog.lab42.com/generation-text-teens-their-texting-habits"" target=""_blank"">a recent survey of teens about their texting habits found that 71 percent preferred texting to phone calling</a>. Time for your organization to start thinking about a mobile strategy? Very possibly.</li>
<li>What's a major donor? Like most nonprofits, your organization probably defines major donors by gift size. Over at Connection Caf</li>

In other words, we put a comma before the <em>and</em> in any list of three or more.</p>","<p>Big Duck uses the Oxford comma (sometimes known as the serial comma) when writing. In other words, we put a comma before the <em>and</em> in any list of three or more.</p>
<p>The serial comma rule is formalized in our in-house style guide. Ducks who miss the serial comma (when writing for our blog, for example) face my wrath. And my father was a minister who worked for years alongside another minister named Rath, so I know what I'm talking about. (Pastor Rath was quite kind, actually.)</p>
<p>Anyway, last week, when the news started spreading that the Oxford style guide claimed their own comma was no longer necessary, <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/team/jenna_silverman"">Jenna</a> raised the issue with me. I've been busier than usual the past couple of weeks, so I believe my knee-jerk response was, ""I don't care. We're still using it.""</p>
<p>I haven't had much of a chance to look into the full story. Thankfully, this morning, I read a <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/161911/oxford-comma-otion"" target=""_blank"">defense of the Oxford comma</a> that I couldn't agree with more. Go there and read it.</p>
<p>Writing about writing, grammar, and punctuation invites scrutiny, not to mention snarky comments from grammarians. So it may come as no surprise that a couple of inconsistencies in the original post are receiving some negative attention in the comments section of her blog.</p>
<p>Even so, I offer my full-throated support of the content and the writer's premise, and her explanation is very good.</p>
<p>You may have perfectly legitimate reasons for not using the Oxford comma. For example, in general, newspapers don't use it (it's my one beef with the <em>AP Stylebook</em>). So if you work in and around media a lot (such as sending out press releases), it might make sense for you to skip that serial comma, as much as it pains me to say so.</p>
<p>But if you haven't really thought about formalizing a rule at your organization, the most important thing for us nonprofiteers is always clarity. And Oxford commas help you be clear.</p>

<p><br /><small><br /></small></p>","<p>There they are. Standing on your doorstep, all spiffed up and optimistic, eager to learn more about you... It's a would-be email list member!</p>
<p>But before you open that door, think fast. The first weeks and months this person is on your list will be your BEST chance to increase their loyalty and likelihood to donate.</p>
<p>So how will you make the most of this all-important first impression?</p>
<p>You'll be happy to know that making a good first impression does NOT always mean launching a super-complex welcome series.</p>
<p>While this option makes sense for <em>some</em> organizations, <strong>you can often get the most bang for your buck by with a few simple tweaks to your opt-in, landing page, and welcome language. </strong></p>
<p>How can you get started? A few ideas and examples for inspiration...</p>
<p><strong>1. Put yourself out there</strong><br />Yep, the most annoying dating advice in the world actually holds true for online engagement as well. No one is going to join your email list if they don't know it exists, right?</p>
<p>So make sure your homepage prominently highlights the ways people can join your list: by taking action, donating, or signing up. Ideally, promote them above the fold and minimize the number of clicks required to complete the action.</p>
<p>350.org's homepage is a great example of smart, prominent placement:</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/d68057cda7f4ce1e30ba2e678fddae66/files/350homepage_signup.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""202"" /></p>
<p>See? 350.org's sign-up is front and center. I don't have to dig through the site to see how to get information, all I have to do is enter my email, city and country and BOOM I'm on the list. Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>2. Invite them in nicely<br /> </strong>Then make sure your opt-in language is both clear about why the person would want to sign-up, and written in friendly, personable language.</p>
<p>Network for Good has a great example of friendly, audience-centric opt-in language:</p>
<p><em>""Subscribe to our free fundraising tips newsletter. (You can always change your mind later!)""</em></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/d68057cda7f4ce1e30ba2e678fddae66/files/networkforgood_optin.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""194"" /><br /><br /></p>
<p>On the face of it, this isn't too different from your standard ""Sign up for our free newsletter"" opt-in. But by making it a ""fundraising tips"" newsletter, it highlights what I, the reader, would find useful about it. And by saying ""(You can always change your mind later!)"" it made signing up feel both friendly and not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be clear about who you are and what you offer</strong><br />The internet is a wild and wooly place. Online audiences have to be on the lookout for spam, scams, and who knows what else. So many sure you demonstrate your credibility and value right from the start, by briefly stating what kind of content a list member can expect, and offering links to examples or archives.</p>
<p>Earthjustice does a great job of this on their eBrief enewsletter signup page:</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/d68057cda7f4ce1e30ba2e678fddae66/files/earthjustice_signup.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""200"" /></p>
<p>By quickly offering links to their current issue and archives, the user is shown what to expect, and the list of this month's articles gives them a quick overview of the kinds of subjects and commentary that Earthjustice provides.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make it easy-breezy, especially at the beginning!</strong><br />Let's be honest--your crush would run screaming if you showed up to a first date in a wedding dress. Well new list members might do the same if you demand too much from them too soon.</p>
<p>Test after test has shown that the more form fields you include, the less likely people are to complete it.</p>
<p>Keep the bar for joining your online list low by minimizing the number of form fields you display on sign-up pages, donation forms, and take action pages.</p>
<p>Mercy Corp's online sign-up is a great example of a short, user-friendly form:</p>

<p><strong>5. Mind your manners--say thank you!</strong><br />Once someone has signed up with your list--you want them to feel good about the decision they've made, right?</p>
<p>So mind your manners by making sure your online forms resolve to a personable thank you page. This page should thank them for joining, explain the difference you'll be making together, and offer several ways to stay involved.</p>
<p>Ocean Conservancy's thank you page for new list members is a nice example (though yours does not have to be quite so detailed, we loved the tone of the page):</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/d68057cda7f4ce1e30ba2e678fddae66/files/oceanconservancy_greatsignupthankyou.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""202"" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Show them why you're such a catch.</strong><br />And last but not least--we come to the oft-neglected auto-generated welcome message to new list members.</p>
<p>The moments after a person has signed up are an amazing opportunity to reiterate your value and cement the relationship with a warm, friendly email that offers the reader something of value. But sadly, one-line emails with ""Subscription confirmation"" subject lines are still woefully common.</p>
<p>Instead, try making sure your welcome message is written like a letter. Open with a ""Dear firstname""-type salutation, and make sure it's signed by a person at your organization. The message should warmly thank the new list member for joining--then share some content that demonstrates why your work is valuable and relevant. Videos, blog posts and slideshows are all good possibilities here.</p>
<p>Though it's not a non-profit welcome itself, John Haydon's welcome message offers some great inspiration for the feeling you might want to capture:</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/d68057cda7f4ce1e30ba2e678fddae66/files/johnhaydon_welcomeemail.jpg"" width=""386"" height=""405"" /></p>
<p>While these some of our favorite big-bang-for-your-buck ways to effectively welcome new list members--it's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of possible tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time for a re-design, but the mere thought sends shivers down your spine? You're not alone. Few things intimidate us as easily and as completely as technology, so we find countless excuses to avoid upgrading, re-designing, or launching:&nbsp; ""We'd love to re-design our site, but we don't have the money... the board will never approve it... I have no idea how to do that... it's not <em>my </em>job... it's not <em>your job</em>...""</p>
<p>So, even though you know your website needs an overhaul, you wait...</p>
<p>Enter Amanda McCormick of <a href=""http://www.jellybeanboom.com/%20"" target=""_blank"">Jelly Bean Boom</a>, and the wonders of WordPress - it's not just for blogs anymore. <a href=""http://storify.com/farra/501technyc-72011-bootstrap-with-wordpress%20"" target=""_blank"">At this month's 501TechNYC event</a>, Amanda explained that WordPress is an, ""Open Source Content Management Framework,"" which essentially means it can host your website. WordPress is a great tool for ""rapid, scalable development that is built around content,"" and it can be remarkably inexpensive to implement. Check out some of Amanda's key tips on getting started below:</p>
<p><strong>'Waiting for Dot Com.' </strong>Naturally, one of the first things you'll need is a web address to call your own. You can find a host like GoDaddy for as little as $3.99 a month and it doesn't take long to sign up. Many of these are ready to work with WordPress sites and you can even find <a href=""http://wordpress.org/hosting"" target=""_blank"">a list of pre-approved WordPress hosts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Think of your website as a box</strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>with a standard layout: header, body, sidebar, and footer. This box is where all of your content goes. No matter how fancy or utilitarian the site, this concept makes the design scheme simple and gives you a framework to start from.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/969nr.jpg"" style=""width: 457px; height: 340px;"" /></p>
<p><strong>Don't think - do! </strong>Experience is the best teacher, so just get started. Set up a ""sandbox"" - your own private place to play - to familiarize yourself with WordPress' different fonts, features, themes, plug-ins, etc., until you're ready for primetime.&nbsp; Since your sandbox is private, it's also a great place to learn basic HTML and CSS, especially if you're not sure what you're doing. Remember, if you're going to play with code, copy and paste the original HTML/CSS into a Word document just in case you don't like latest creation.</p>
<p><strong>Don't re-invent the wheel. </strong>You don't have to be a designer to get started. Check out other WordPress-powered sites to find out which themes you like best. <a href=""http://www.wordpress.org/showcase"" target=""_blank"">Try whetting your palate with some of the sites WordPress highlights.</a> Changing your theme is simple. Don't be afraid to try a few out before you publish.</p>
<p><strong>Customize. Personalize. Socialize.</strong> Your WordPress site is not a blog. Customize it with features that your fans and followers want to see, and that you want to show them. Add events, call-to-action buttons, tailored landing pages, and make it easy for them to 'Like' your Facebook page, engage with you on Twitter, and share your content. Plug-ins will let you add plenty of great functions, but remember that these are designed mostly by third parties and unintended bugginess could be part of the package.</p>
<p><strong>Never stop learning, never stop playing.</strong> WordPress is a popular platform, so it's easy to discover new widgets, plug-ins, and tutorials scattered across the web. Check out YouTube for 'How-To' videos, and, when in doubt, Google it. You'll turn up plenty of tips and tricks on features and customizations.</p>

Zappos hopes you'll call and chat with their friendly reps about it. They'd be delighted to help, no matter how long it takes. And who can forget about free shipping?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what does good customer service mean for a nonprofit? Donor relations? Client or member relations? Community relations? Most organizations have so many different types of relationships it's hard to know where to start, much less fund.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/f1a762735a1623250b4afeccc3282104/files/images_0.jpg"" width=""337"" height=""150"" /><br /><br />In a talk I gave with <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/"" target=""_blank"">Katya Andresen</a> and <a href=""http://www.marketingfornonprofits.org/"" target=""_blank"">Jocelyn Harmon</a> about <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/miss_manners_online_communications_etiquette"" target=""_blank"">online etiquette</a> at the 2011 Bridge to Integrated Marketing Conference, Katya talked about how great customer service should be more central for nonprofits. Her comments got me thinking: what if we spent less time focusing on building our lists with new names and more time practicing pro-active customer service? Would attrition still be as bad?<br /><br />Great customer service often means setting up systems and processes to make people feel like they're your only client, even when they're not.<br /><br />Want your donors to feel serviced? Make sure your executive director personally calls a few people who make significant gifts each week. Send out a prompt thank you for every gift. Don't ask so much that they start to feel like ATM machines. And make that online donation form easy and fast to complete.<br /><br />In your clients' case, great customer service may mean respecting their time as much as you do your own. Keep waiting times for services short, offer flexible job-friendly hours when they can reach you, and use unjargony, easy-to-complete forms.<br /><br />As consumers, we've all had great and terrible customer services experiences. But somehow we fall asleep at the wheel when it comes to how we do our own work. Maybe it's time to wake up?<br />&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1","","","","what_your_nonprofit_can_learn_from_zappos","customer-service client-relationships jargon Experiential-communications","","",

The conference made its New York debut, after passing through San Francisco and Washington, DC, where it similarly drew large crowds of eager nonprofit staffers, enthusiastic consultants, and yes, even a few services.</p>
<p>The NYC event's <a href=""http://socialmedia4nonprofits.org/nyc/"" target=""_blank"">program and speakers</a> offered a good blend of the familiar and the new, and seemed to garner some rave reviews (<a href=""https://twitter.com/#%21/search/%23sm4np"" target=""_blank"">if you can believe everything you read on Twitter</a>). I presented some thoughts on multi-channel fundraising strategies (slides embedded below), walking through <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/projects/national_military_family_association/campaign"" target=""_blank"">the year-end campaign Big Duck developed last year for the National Military Family Association</a>. I did my best to stress the importance of starting with a big idea or story that lays out the problem/solution your campaign addresses; highlighting clear, compelling, and easy actions for your community; and then integrating that across various channels. Curious? Be sure to check out the ten steps we suggest in the slides.</p>
<p>Here were some of the takeaways that really resonated with me from the other speakers:</p>
<p>* Focus your social media efforts on a three-part blend of listening, joining, and creating real, engaging, and valuable content. Know what makes you different (and delicious!) and let that guide you. Take time to measure and analyze your impact. Try this <a href=""https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/bigducknyc.com/ccc?key=0Auim7mCKWRJsdEVHYTRHOV9oUVV0dk5rR1plbWFyOGc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CIGr7Y4D#gid=0"" target=""_blank"">handy metrics dashboard</a> for starters.<br />~ Amy Sample Ward, NTEN; Social Media Done Right in 30 Minutes a Day (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/amy-sample-ward-social-media-done-right-in-30-minutes-a-day"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* If you don't have a good story or message to tell, using lots of social media tools won't help. You should think of your website and email list as the skeleton/main body of your efforts. Then put on your Twitter earrings and your YouTube sweater.<br />~ Ami Dar, Idealist;&nbsp; Hype and Hope on the web: what works, what doesn't, and what can we all do together</p>
<p>* Start thinking about mobile and embrace it. Consider SMS, apps, QR codes and more. And be creative--one organization has a QR code on their business cards that links to a video of its founders explaining who the organization is and why it exists.<br />~ Andy Steggles, Higher Logic; Social Media on the Go: Crafting a Mobile Strategy (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/andy-steggles-social-media-on-the-go-crafting-a-mobile-strategy"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* The Causes application on Facebook lets you empower your supporters to raise money and engage their friends on your behalf. To be successful, do what you can to mirror your offline community-building efforts and share stories, photos/videos, and impact on a regular basis.<br />~ Matt Mahan, Causes;&nbsp; The Secret Sauce of Fundraising: Facebook Causes (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/matthew-mahan-causes"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* Focus on being inspirational and the dollars will come. The key to success is making sure that your content (videos, blogs, information visualizations) is shareable. Every fundraising campaign is a mini 'word-of-mouth' movement.<br />~ Paull Young, charity:water; Social Media-Fueled Impact: A charity:water Case Study (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/paull-young-social-mediafueled-impact-a-charitywater-case-study"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* Ask the data what's working. Gather the info, analyze it, then change how you act.<br />~ George Weiner, Do Something; What Does the Data Say? Turning Tweets into Action (<a href=""http://prezi.com/hmc_dmnfjjvw/what-does-the-data-say-tweets-into-action/"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* For a campaign to be successful, (whether fundraising or marketing) all channels and messaging must be aligned.<br />~ David Boyce, Fundly; How to Launch a Social Fundraising Campaign (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/dave-boyce-dave-boyce-fundlyhow-to-launch-a-social-fundraising-campaign"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* If you have a physical space, try using geo-location tools like Foursquare to build relationships with your community.<br />~Johannes Neuer, New York Public Library; GPS.org--Using Geo-Location Services to Promote Your Nonprofit (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/johannes-neuer-gpsorg-using-geolocation-services-to-promote-your-nonprofit"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* Treat all donors like major donors. Also, when it comes to your message and social media, you have already lost control--and that's okay, you never had it.<br />~ Alex Ohanian, Hipmunk; The Benevolent Web (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/alexis-ohanian-8781729"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>
<p>* Measure your ROE: Return on Engagement to learn the true value of social media. It's less important to track the pure #s of fans and followers, and more to look at how they respond, share, and connect with you.<br />~ Debra Askanase, Community Organizer 2.0; Creating and Measuring Return on Engagement (<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/debra-askanase-creating-and-measuring-return-on-engagement"" target=""_blank"">slides</a>)</p>

<p>Big Duck worked with the two organization's staff and boards on the merger's communications. Over a few months, we set a new communications strategy for the organization, developed their visual identity and messaging platform, created a style guide, gave their website a facelift, and more. (When it was over, their staff was thrilled to get rid of us, I'm sure.)</p>
<p>Recently, I visited them in their office to talk about their fundraising and conduct an informal brand check up. To get started, they collected all the materials they'd produced in-house or with vendors over the past year or so. They printed out screen shots of websites, social media, and other online communications. They grouped the communications by area (fundraising, patient services, etc). We gathered the entire communications team and the executive director in the room and talked it all through.</p>
<p>To guide our conversation, I began by asking about the positioning statement we'd created in 2008. Positioning is the big idea we want people to think of when they think of the organization. In their case, new areas of work had been added and it seemed that their original positioning was too specific. We agreed it might need to be refined after strategic planning (currently in the works) was complete.</p>
<p>I asked about their personality: the list of attributes we developed through our brandraising process. Seemed the personality was still on track, but certain attributes ('innovative' and 'trustworthy', for example) were rising to the top.</p>
<p>Then we reviewed their materials using their positioning and personality as a guide. I was really impressed with their work. Despite growth and some staff changes in their in-house communications staff, the materials looked, felt and read very consistently. Without exception, they used the visual identity outlined in the style guide flawlessly, and reinforced their positioning and personality.</p>
<p>The work had clearly 'stuck'. Why? Because they'd done a great job hiring good staff to develop it in-house, staying true to their style guide, and being strategic. They'd resisted the temptation to change things out of boredom or to 'mix it up'. As a result, each piece connected to the others and sent consistent messages about the quality and credibility of their work.</p>
<p>Doing a brand check up this way is easy and cheap. Consider spending an hour reviewing your nonprofit's materials this way yearly. You might even invite a board member or volunteer with marketing or communications expertise to join you and weigh in. Better yet, ask a donor or a client to join the conversation. And please let me know how it goes.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2059%1,1066%2","","","","brand_check_up","Identity Experiential-communications Brandraising National-Brain-Tumor-Society consistency checkup brand","","",

<p>One of the perks of interning at Big Duck is interacting with truly passionate, opinionated people on a daily basis. While our views may vary on many topics, we can all agree on one thing: our love of food. Ducks will jump at the chance to chow down together, and this past Wednesday was no different.<br /><br /> It's been months since the peanut butter taste-off, and we believed it was high time for another food-related festivity. After much debate, we decided on a theme: Dumpling Day! The next step was to figure out the logistics--where would the dumplings come from? How many would we get? What kind of dumplings did we want? And most importantly, who would pick them up?<br /><br /> This is where we, Big Duck's faithful interns, came in; Abby saw the opportunity for an intern adventure and seized it. In no time, the ""cheap dumpling tour"" was born. It was decided that we would scour the city in search of the most delicious, wallet-friendly dumplings. We would taste test the treats on Tuesday, report back with our choices and then go snag the snacks for Wednesday's Dumpling Day.<br /><br /> With the input of our fellow Ducks, plus a little bit of our own research, we compiled a list of the best dumpling places, conveniently located in nearby Chinatown. We took a page out of Scrooge McDuck's book and cashed in our office swear jar at TD Bank. Our pocket change turned into dumpling dollars-- a whopping 250 dumplings worth!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/dumpling_map.jpg"" style=""width: 386px; height: 279px;"" /><br /><br /> Money in hand, we hit the first stop on the Tour de Dumplings: Prosperity Dumpling (to be noted: also Abby's dumpling joint of choice). In a space barely bigger than a shoebox, we placed our order and received our tiny bundles of joy almost immediately. Bargain-basement prices (only $1 for 5 dumplings) and quick service? What's not to love!<br /><br /> Dumplings in hand, we dashed off to our next location: Vanessa's Dumping House. Vanessa's gave more of a sit-down-and-stay-a-while vibe--perhaps that explains our long wait time. We opted not to eat there, figuring we'd make a more objective decision in a neutral location: a nearby park. Armed with dipping sauces and napkins, we dug in.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/dumpling_photo.jpg"" style=""width: 386px; height: 290px;"" /><br /><br /> After sampling each dumpling, we knew there was a clear winner, but we forged on with the tour. The final stop was Fried Dumpling, which made Prosperity Dumpling seem like a fifty-room mansion. Out of all our dumpling destinations, Fried received the worst reviews.<br /><br /> On our way back to the F train, we both rubbed our bellies in near silence-- that is, until we passed a tiny bakery called Everything Frosted. Yes, we had just spent the better part of our walk grumbling about how full we were, but who can say no to a cupcake? Like the true intern companions that we are, we each bought a cupcake to share. Mine was Pink Champagne flavored, Abby's was a Lemon Drop, and they were both to die for.<br /><br /> Officially stuffed to the gills, we returned to DUMBO and shared our results. For your viewing pleasure, Abby has designed a chart... and the winner is (drum roll please): Prosperity Dumplings!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/dumpling_rating_chart.jpg"" style=""width: 386px; height: 322px;"" /></p>
<p>Prosperity, with their perfect meat to chive proportions, had the juiciest, most mouth-watering dumplings of the bunch. Crispy in all the right places, mushy in all the others--the dumplings were irresistible. Vanessa's dumplings were a close second, and not to be discounted. In my opinion, they were a bit too crispy--I prefer things on the soggy side. They were tasty, but they couldn't top Prosperity. Fried's dumplings were simply atrocious--perhaps it's because they had such solid competition from Vanessa's and Prosperity, or because our taste buds were tired. Either way, they didn't stack up.</p>
<p>In an effort to make Vanessa's feel less like a jilted-pageant queen, we decided to get our veggie dumplings from there the next day. &nbsp;(We're too kind, we know.)</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite dumpling joint? Feel free to share it with us in the comment section. We interns love any excuse for an adventure; perhaps your suggestions will be included in our next food tour!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","dumpling_day_shenanigans_i","Around-the-office food-challenge interns dumplings chinatown","","",

You've read the tale of our first dumpling recon mission (if not, check it out <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/dumpling_day_shenanigans_i"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), and we've returned for round deux of our Dumpling Day shenanigans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>The details of the day are a bit fuzzy due to a dumpling-induced food coma, but I can share what I do remember. Dumpling Day fell on one of the hottest days of the year, which made for a very cranky intern. The idea of venturing out of the cool air in the Big Duck office and into the brick wall of heat otherwise known as the subway system in August was about as appealing to me as pulling out my eyelashes one by one.</p>
<p>Alas, I couldn't let Abby go on the mission alone, just as she couldn't leave a fellow intern behind. Thanks to Abby's cleverly designed dumpling ordering form, we were able to snag both of our orders relatively quickly and painlessly.</p>
<p>(Although, I do need to give a shout out to the kind worker at Vanessa's Dumpling House who handed me a single fork for my order of 40 vegetable dumplings. As crazed and hungry as I probably looked, I don't think it's physically possible to eat 40 veggie dumplings in one sitting--and no, that is not a challenge.)<br /><br /> Upon our return to the office, we were met with a roomful of hungry faces staring up at us. We were peppered with questions, comments and concerns--did we get all the dumplings? Would they be as delectable as we claimed? What took so long! Did we get extra?--immediately followed by a stampede to the center of the room to attack the dumpling delivery. According to Dan, you could smell us walking down the hallway, so everyone was well prepared to pounce.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/sidebar/6020019077_ea0b02a2d0_b.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 263px;"" /><br /><small>Photo by myinnerfatty</small></p>
<p>To say that the dumplings were gone in a matter of minutes would be an understatement. The room was silent, sans the sound of happy chewing and the occasional moan of approval. The vegetable dumplings, which we snagged for our sausage-free friends, were just as delicious as we had hoped. The pork and chive dumplings were just as juicy as promised--so juicy, in fact, the extra 2 orders of dumplings disappeared without a trace. (I blame the design team.) The bonus treats, in the form of pork buns and sesame pancakes, received rave reviews. As Sonny pointed out, there is a bit of delicious irony in eating duck pancakes--we're essentially eating our namesake.</p>
<p><img alt=""Duck pancake"" src=""/sites/default/files/sidebar/2733391334_177903e7f1_b.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 263px;"" /><br /><small>Photo by Adam Kuban</small></p>
<p>All in all, Dumpling Day was a smashing success. In the words of Abby, ""we got the dumplings, we ate the dumplings, and everyone was happy."" (And perhaps a bit sleepy--there was more than one request for naptime that afternoon. With a belly filled with dumpling deliciousness, could you blame us?)</p>
<p>But for Big Duck's smallest Ducks (does that make us ducklings?), the dumpling tour, and the following feast, gave us a chance to step out of our comfort zones, do a little bonding, and learn a lesson or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one, it encouraged us to let our voices be heard. As you may remember, Prosperity Dumpling, our Dumpling Day champion, was Abby's original suggestion. Contributing to the conversation and then having your statement accepted and affirmed by a roomful of your colleagues is a great feeling. It may have only been about dumplings, but it reminded us that our coworkers value our opinions.</p>
<p>Secondly, it showed us that stepping out of your comfort zone can be a good thing. Confession: until last week, I was a dumpling virgin. I have an irrational fear of soy sauce thus preventing me from enjoying any and all Asian cuisine. With the help of Abby, I tried a food that I never would have touched before. I was pushed out of my bubble and into the wonderful world of dumplings.<br /><br /> Finally, the dumpling tour helped to strengthen our intern team. In many workplaces, an intern's suggestion to take a two-hour excursion from the office would be met with laughter and a request to get more coffee. While the Ducks are a more accepting bunch, we were still stumped at to why they not only let us go on a dumpling tour, but applauded our initiative. A day or two later, it dawned on us; Dumpling Day was a team building exercise in disguise.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/sidebar/333862325_8a043f99f3_b.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 233px;"" /><br /><small><i>Intern team: assemble! </i>Photo by mape_s</small></p>
<p>All summer, we've jokingly been referred to as one person: the interns. When we were awarded Duck of the Week (we know, we're awesome), it was given to us as a group, not as three individual Ducks. Our coworkers were simply trying to tell us to tap into each other's talents and resources--without shoving it down our throats.<br /><br /> It may have taken an impromptu tour of Chinatown for us to get the message, but it worked. So thank you, Ducks. As the saying goes, three heads are better than one--and hey, if we're one person, we're an extremely well-rounded one.<br /><br /> Our lesson to you: when it comes to cheap eating, interns usually know what they're talking about. We are, for the most part, struggling college students, therefore veritable experts on the best place to grab a bite for a few bucks. It's part of the intern survival code, so listen when we share these pearls of knowledge.&nbsp;Also of note: the smell of dumplings, while appetizing at first, is rather pungent and extremely difficult to rid yourself of. Trust me on that.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","dumpling_day_shenanigans_part_ii","Around-the-office food-challenge interns dumplings chinatown","","",

<p>We Ducks are proud to host the Carnival again this September, and we've cooked (fried?) up a topic that we think you'll enjoy even more than the bumper cars:</p>
<p><strong>Multi-channel bootcamp</strong></p>
<p>Whether you want to raise funds or raise your profile, weaving your communications together across different channels (websites, direct mail, events, social media, and more) is key to making an impact.</p>
<p>So if you're a reader, sit tight--September's Carnival will be in town soon, full of tips, examples, and guidelines to help you get those communications toned and tightened. While you're waiting, whet your appetite for integrated communications by perusing <a href=""http://www.convio.com/signup/guides/integrated-multi-channel-marketing/"" target=""_blank"">Convio's recently-released study on this very subject</a>, or <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog/"" target=""_blank"">check out August's edition of the Carnival from Kivi Leroux Miller</a> on kooky, quirky, and off-beat ideas for nonprofit communicators.</p>
<p>If you're a blogger, the fun begins now. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write up a post with ideas, inspiration, suggestions, stories--anything you like, really, as long as it's about multi-channel communications. You can also flip through past posts to see if there's something you've written lately that fits the bill.</li>
<li>Email your permalink to <a href=""mailto:nonprofitcarnival@gmail.com"">nonprofitcarnival@gmail.com</a> or <a href=""http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_12828.html"" target=""_blank"">fill out this handy form</a> by <strong>Tuesday, 9/27</strong>.</li>
<li>We'll sift through the many excellent entries and choose the ones that work best with our theme. Posts that are easy to read and were written relatively recently (within the last month or two) are best. Any post mentioning ducks gets special consideration.</li>
<li>Check back in at the Duck Call on Thursday, 9/29 to see if we've included your post.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carnival is a great way to drive traffic to your blog, so we hope you'll submit a post and tell all your friends to do the same.</p>
<p>Race you to the ring toss!</p>
<p><strong>What's a nonprofit blog carnival, and is there funnel cake?</strong><a name=""carnival""></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Carnival is a monthly roundup of posts on different topics relevant to nonprofits. It travels from blog to blog, and each month, the host declares a theme and collects the best posts on that topic from around the web, bringing them all together for your reading and learning pleasure. We're still working on the funnel cake part.</p>

Four quick tips to get the ball rolling","Sarah Durham","1050","","<p>This is the time of year when most people I know are thinking about 'back to school' and beginning to plan their fall/winter holidays and vacations.

Of course for us Ducks and most of you, this time of year is dominated by the ever-glorious year-end fundraising appeal.</p>
<p>These days, the year-end giving season starts as early as October. In fact, as I write this (in mid-August), we're already at work on several year-end&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/campaigns"">campaigns</a>. If you're not quite there yet, here are a few quick tips I hope you'll find useful to get your fundraising wheels in motion.</p>
<p><strong>Consider driving your appeal this year with a theme or concept that's bigger than just 'we need your help'.</strong> We Ducks are partial to ideas that inspire emotions, don't focus on the negative or sound desperate, and provide lots good opportunities for audiences to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Make it unique.</strong> What have you been up to that you can speak about that's really engaging? Why should I support you and not your peers this year-end? Tell me more, please.</p>
<p><strong>Plan it out proactively. </strong>Don't wait until the 11th hour to start writing and designing. This year, map out a calendar that details the emails you'll send, how you'll use social media, what will happen on your website, and what'll go in the mail. Map out the timing in detail and block out your personal work calendar now so you actually have a shot at making it happen.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>don't forget about December 31.</strong> It's dazzling how many people give on this date. Don't forget to ask them- ideally with email on that date.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1405%2","","","","year_end_appeals_have_you_stumped","Fundraising Campaigns year-end-appeals","","<p>Photo: University of Iowa | digital.lib.uiowa.edu/wpe</p>",

It's as if they've just entered a ""fun zone,"" freed up to take a break, and laugh a little even though they're here for work.</p>","<p>Every once in a while, I see the reaction of a client walking into our office, as they see that giant signage with the Big Duck logo, and walk into a space with bright orange walls. It's as if they've just entered a ""fun zone,"" freed up to take a break, and laugh a little even though they're here for work.</p>
<p>This makes me think about my own time here, an almost five-year tenure in the trenches with my fellow Ducks. I have to say, one of the things that I enjoy the most about working at Big Duck, besides the work, are the people that I work with. We put a lot of stock into having laughs. We even put it under <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/values"" target=""_blank"">""Good fun"" in our values</a>.</p>
<p>Nonprofiteers are serious people. They've made a choice to dedicate their lives towards a goal that they're passionate about. Some of the issues are pretty heady. How can one even laugh when there are some serious things happening in the world? Well, sometimes the answer is, ""how can you not?"" Humor is a great coping mechanism. It's a great way to relieve stress, and break down social barriers. But besides amusement, it can all be used in great effect to further your cause and spread your message. How many viral videos are forwarded because they're funny?</p>
<p>Humor can be a valuable tool. How can you harness its power?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, make time for it.</strong> When you have brainstorming sessions in the office, allocate a good half hour up front to be inappropriate. Seriously. The best results that we've gotten from these meetings occur when they happen organically, when we turned half-baked ideas that we all laugh about into great ideas that we pitch. We recently completed a brandraising process for a terrific organization called <a href=""http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/"" target=""_blank"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>. I can't even begin to share the great brainstorming sessions we had, but we're especially proud of <a href=""http://bigducknyc.com/projects/fight_colorectal_cancer/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">the tagline we came up for them</a>: Get behind a cure. Get it? Get it??</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be open and honest. Some subjects may seem sensitive, and not for public consumption, but perhaps that's precisely the reason why it needs to be talked about--loudly, proudly, and owned. A psychiatrist at an organization for torture survivors once told us that the ""gallows humor"" that comes up in groups can be very powerful. And I'm sure at least some of you have seen <a href=""http://www.feelyourboobies.com/"" target=""_blank"">this breast cancer campaign</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use humor to inspire action. If you're producing a video, don't just make it funny, pay it off. Connect it back to&nbsp; your organization, and ask the audience to take some sort of action. If you haven't seen this, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQTtMXZs2LA&amp;feature=channel_video_title"" target=""_blank"">check out this PSA</a> that an old client of ours, the American Jewish World Service, produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, humor may not work for every organization. It should be considered carefully, with the context and audience in mind. But when done truthfully and well, boy, it can be quite effective.</p>
<p>I leave you with this video for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation's <a href=""http://www.impatientoptimists.org/posts/2011/07/lets-reinvent-the-toilet"" target=""_blank"">Reinventing the Toilet campaign</a>. No less than 5 different people saw fit to forward it to me. I have nooooooo idea why.</p>
<p>What nonprofits are using humor well? What effective uses of humor have you seen in the nonprofit world?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1408%1,2094%2,2059%3,2148%4,2103%5,2847%6,2848%7","","","","blog/good_humor","Personality Identity Experiential-communications values nptech Humor Good-fun","Personality Identity Experiential-communications values nptech Humor Good-fun","",

Our topic this month: multichannel communications.<br /><br />We've gathered some great posts from 'round the web into an invigorating <strong>Multichannel Communications Bootcamp</strong> for your reading and learning pleasure. (If a bootcamp at a carnival sounds like a contradiction in terms, don't worry--I'm not a very tough task master, and you can eat all the cotton candy you want.)<br /><br /><strong>Warm it up</strong><br />What is multichannel anyway? For nonprofits, it's a way to approach your marketing work, integrating all the different tools and channels you use to communicate (websites, direct mail, events, email, etc.). An effective multichannel program takes into account all of your many communications opportunities and makes sure that your donors, volunteers, supporters, and clients have a consistent experience of your organization wherever they look.<br /><br />Integrated communications are extra important in our fast-paced world of information overload, where reaching someone in the right place at the right time with the right message is the key to making change and raising dollars.<br /><br />Here are a few helpful posts to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're interested in learning more about what integrated marketing means for nonprofits and why it's so important, these two studies released earlier this summer are worth a read: the <a href=""http://www.convio.com/signup/guides/integrated-multi-channel-marketing/"" target=""_blank"">Convio Integrated Multi-Channel Marketing Report</a> and the <a href=""http://www.blackbaud.com/bb/targetanalytics/multi-channel.aspx"" target=""_blank"">2011 donorCentrics Internet and MultiChannel Giving Benchmarking Report</a>.</li>

<li>Here's <a href=""http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/13-elements-to-the-philosophy-of-integration-4099"" target=""_blank"">an interesting summary of the philosophy of integration</a>, as presented by David DeBetta, from The Nonprofit Times. One of my favorite points: ""Integration can involve as few as two channels."" It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Raise, raise, raise those funds!</strong></p>
<p>Multichannel fundraising is hot stuff these days, and we received a number of interesting posts about how integration can help bring in the dollars.</p>

<li>As Jeff Brooks points out, <a href=""http://www.futurefundraisingnow.com/future-fundraising/2011/09/the-right-way-to-integrate-your-marketing-and-fundraising.html"" target=""_blank"">an integrated approach to raising funds means more than just updating your materials</a>--it has implications for your team, too, and for the way you work together to get your messages across clearly and consistently.</li>

<p>I traded the PE for Mozart and was shocked, it totally worked. With Mozart on, I was a genius! Or at least I felt like one. I felt confident, intelligent, and focused. I was suddenly undaunted by the amount of information I had to stuff in my brain. It was powerful stuff.</p>

<p>Our office is in a neighborhood blessed with lots of creativity. During the standard lap around DUMBO you'll see art covering a full spectrum of moods and mediums on the walls and in the windows. Sculpture, photography, graffiti, street art; it's all here. As a designer, working around here is very good for what I do. Mozart good. It's creative brain food and it's everywhere.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/hand.jpg"" style=""width: 534px; height: 589px;"" /></p>
<p>To me, there's nothing as inspiring as art put up for the non-paying public, without credit, often under the threat of arrest.</p>

<p>If you don't know Taproot, you probably should. Unlike traditional foundations that make cash grants, the Taproot Foundation makes grants of professional consulting services, called Service Grants, through their Service Grant Program. Every Service Grant is delivered pro bono by a team of 5-6 business professionals who volunteer their time and expertise to help a nonprofit in their community. Good stuff, right?</p>
<p>Lower Manhattan offices are typically dominated by cubicles, windowless offices, and generic signage. Taproot has broken the mold, though: their office is bright, cheery, and very on-brand. The space isn't fancy or expensive. It's open, painted in their key brand color, and punctuated by interesting light fixtures. Other touches like a muppet-like puppet that greets you at the front desk if nobody's there, or their tagline, ""Make it Matter"" in big letters on the wall are inexpensive but add to the space's humanity and warmth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my workshop, I asked the participants to free associate with the adjectives that the Taproot office brings to mind. <em>Friendly, warm, innovative, open</em> came up. The staff was delighted.</p>
<p>To express your nonprofit's personality in your offices or program spaces more fully, consider the following low-cost ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paint at least one accent wall using your brand's main color, with the rest of the walls a clean white. Avoid using the drab, institutional colors many office buildings suggest.</li>
<li>Use vinyl to post your logo, tagline, or mission statement visibly and boldly rather than using the building's generic signage.&nbsp; Just google 'vinyl signage' to find a vendor near you.</li>
<li>Consider going with open desks rather than cubicles.</li>
<li>Consider sourcing your furniture at nontraditional places like Ikea, flea markets, or antique stores to break out of the cubicle box and add some texture.</li>
<li>Use funky chairs and tables as accent pieces to add warmth.</li>
<li>Display photos of your clients prominently in your waiting areas.</li>

<p>Last week was <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/165880058617/"" target=""_blank"">501 Tech NYC</a>, and this month it was all about innovation. <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/daveiam"" target=""_blank"">David J. Neff</a>, who together with <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/RandalC"" target=""_blank"">Randall C. Moss</a> wrote <a href=""http://www.thefutureofnonprofits.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Future of Nonprofits: Innovate and Thrive in the Digital Age</em></a> (and who was kind enough to give us Ducks access to a preview copy of the book earlier this year), gave a great presentation about why innovation is important for nonprofits and how to set about becoming more innovative. <!--break--></p>
<p>David covered a lot of great ground (both in the presentation and in the book), but for me the top takeaway is (drum roll, please):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Innovation is essential and achievable for nonprofits, even though it sounds fancy-pants and scary.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you'll allow me to expand further (doing my best to summarize David and Randall):</p>
<h3>Innovation is essential</h3>
<p>The world in which your nonprofit operates and the people you serve are constantly changing, and changing fast. You need to keep up with those changes--or, better, outpace them--if you want to stay effective and relevant. Coming up with new ways to achieve your mission, new ways to serve and delight your constituents, and new ways to engage people in what you do (all otherwise known as innovation) is the key to changing with the times and staying in business.</p>
<h3>Innovation is achievable</h3>
<p>Innovation sounds like something that only big businesses with huge budgets and dedicated armies of research and development staff can afford to spend time on. But it doesn't have to be. Relatively simple systems and processes can lay the foundation for becoming a more nimble and innovative organization. The book lays it all out in much greater (and clearer) detail, but some of the simple steps that David and Randall suggest to become a more innovative organization are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encourage your staff to regularly take time out from their day-to-day work to think about how your organization could improve</strong>. Being quick, efficient, and productive is great for some things (like payroll and donation processing), but <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703584804576144192132144506.html?mod=dist_smartbrief&amp;mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read"" target=""_blank"">efficiency isn't best when it comes to being creative</a>. Without creative thinking, it's difficult to innovate, so it's well worth giving staff time to think creatively about their work and rewarding people when they make creative suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Do something with those ideas</strong>. Creative new ideas aren't any good if you don't do anything with them. David and Randall point out that the biggest part of being an innovative organization isn't having creative ideas but being able to act on good ideas when you find them. To be able to do that, you need a system for reviewing new ideas, sorting the good from the bad, testing the good ones, and then putting the successful ones into practice. In his presentation, David gave this very simple (and tried and true) process for doing just that:
<ul>
<li><em>Intake</em>. Have a system for collecting people's ideas for improvement--even a simple comments box or online form will do.</li>
<li><em>First review</em>. Set up a team (made up of people from different departments and levels within the organization) that meets regularly to review the ideas that come in and sort the good from the bad. I know, I know--the last thing you want to do is set up a new committee, but David made the great point that an objective review team is important, or ideas tend not to get past someone's immediate (and already overworked) manager.</li>
<li><em>Business case</em>. When the committee finds a good idea, approach the person it came from and ask them to write a business case outlining why (and how) it should be implemented.</li>
<li><em>Development and testing</em>. If the business case is sound, dedicate a small budget to running a pilot project to see if the business case holds in real life.</li>
<li><em>Launch the ideas that work</em>. And finally, if testing is successful, move beyond the test phase and launch the new program, process, structure, or product for real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so scary after all, right? Sure, you may have a way to go before you get all of those things in place and running smoothly, but when it's all laid out simply like that, suddenly innovation (and thriving) seems a lot more achievable.</p>

<p>I sent an email in August to Sarah Durham, principal of Big Duck.&nbsp; Almost instantaneously my inbox pinged with an autoreply that caused me to do a fist pump in celebration.&nbsp; Now, first, let me be clear:&nbsp; I promise I'm not that boring.&nbsp; I don't sit around waiting to read autoreply messages.&nbsp; Yet here it was - a bold, transparent, honest autoresponse declaring to the world in the subject line:&nbsp; ""Brain on Vacation.""&nbsp; The text of Sarah's message continued:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><em>Got a stack of worthwhile periodicals taunting you in the corner? No time to think those big, productive thoughts that might really change your work or your life for the better?</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><em>Yep, I know the feeling. That's why you're getting my autoresponder, in fact. I'm taking a few weeks out of the office for a combination of vacation, writing, and thinking-big-thoughts time.</em></p>
<p>She concluded: ""Until I'm back, please consider me off the grid.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting ""off the grid"" is a daunting challenge for every effective nonprofit leader I know.&nbsp; We are primary decision-makers, chief fundraisers, key liaisons, buck-stops-here types who rarely prioritize taking care of self.</p>
<p>Like so many nonprofit professionals, I'm driven, passionate &amp; ambitious.&nbsp; I see great challenges in our world and will often stop at nothing to fix them.&nbsp; Yet early on in my tenure as an Executive Director as the demands and pressures of social sector leadership began to take a personal toll, I resolved to figure out how a focused, motivated leader can nonetheless attain a sense of wholeness and balance in the midst of an overwhelmingly busy life.&nbsp; I asked every nonprofit leader I respected how they achieved it and I spent time reading, thinking and teaching on the topic.&nbsp; I've synthesized these learnings into the ""Ten <em>Life</em> Imperatives for a Successful Nonprofit Leader."" &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Develop a <em>personal</em> life mission statement:</strong>&nbsp; Your organization's mission is a constant and primary force in your world; balance that with a <em>life</em> mission statement that keeps your personal imperatives for wholeness front and center, as well.</li>
<li><strong>Appoint a <em>personal </em>board of directors:&nbsp; </strong>While they don't govern your life, these individuals do provide meaningful insight and strategic guidance on the big questions.&nbsp; The qualifications are simple:&nbsp; appoint people you respect who know you and your values well, who will reflexively have <u>your</u> best interests in mind &amp; who will carve out time.&nbsp; These are ""big picture"" types who view the world and see opportunities for you in it.&nbsp; Consider these questions:&nbsp; Who has led a life well-lived and now may be willing to help you do the same?&nbsp; Who willingly gives you their undivided attention?&nbsp; Who is on a similar life journey, but is further down the road?</li>
<li><strong>Find a mentor or coach:</strong>&nbsp; There is one qualifying characteristic:&nbsp; What wise person do you know who has a job like yours, but on a much larger scale?&nbsp; That person will be too busy to say yes, but don't take no for an answer.&nbsp; You need the experience and wisdom they have to offer.</li>
<li><strong>Manage your calendar ruthlessly:&nbsp; </strong>Think twice before delegating control of your calendar to a colleague.&nbsp; What you accomplish on any given day will be framed by the way you've structured your time.</li>
<li><strong>Have a private space for thought work:</strong>&nbsp; When I teach on this topic, I ask leaders to tell me where they are when they get their best ideas.&nbsp; Responses cross the spectrum:&nbsp; swimming, biking, taking a shower, sitting in a coffee shop, and yes - one bold gentleman proudly declared, ""on the toilet.""&nbsp; Not once has someone responded, ""Sitting at my desk returning emails.""&nbsp; You simply must find ways to spend more time in the place where you do your best thinking.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Do more of what energizes you and less of the other</strong>:&nbsp; While you can't off-load all of the mundane work, for every task ask yourself, ""Can someone else do this as well or better than me?""&nbsp; If so - delegate it and focus on what energizes and inspires you.</li>
<li><strong>Balance 1-time, 2-time, 3-time:</strong>&nbsp; This isn't my original idea, but it's a good one.&nbsp; 1-time is time spent alone.&nbsp; 2-time is when you are with a significant other.&nbsp; 3-time is social activity in groups.&nbsp; Ensuring that you maintain balance in each of these three spheres is critical.&nbsp; For the nonprofit leader, the biggest risk is that you overdose on 3-time with your staff, board, donors, volunteers &amp; collaborators, shortchanging the others.</li>
<li><strong>Take a Sabbath Day once a week:</strong>&nbsp; This is also not an original idea with a source of much greater authority than my own.&nbsp; Take yourself ""off the grid"" one day each week and revel in the beauty of your life.</li>
<li><strong>When you vacation, <em>vacation:</em></strong>&nbsp; Honestly, if you fail to stay connected to email while you are away, your organization will not implode - but over time, <em>you</em> might.&nbsp; Give a discerning colleague your cell number and tell the rest of your team that he or she knows how to get in touch with you.&nbsp; You'll likely find that you won't get a call and reluctantly realize that your input wasn't as critical as you thought.&nbsp; Pat yourself on the back for developing a talented team.</li>
<li><strong>Always stay connected to the ""Why"":</strong>&nbsp; I keep a question on my desk - ""Why are you here today?""&nbsp; As nonprofit leaders, we are usually a number of steps removed from the ""real"" programmatic work of the mission.&nbsp; But don't let yourself get disconnected from what author Bill Hybels calls your ""holy discontent"" - that thing that you saw in the world that you knew just wasn't right and led you to go all in on fixing it.&nbsp; Stay close to that.&nbsp; Experience it.&nbsp; Feel it.&nbsp; And keep your passions burning.</li>

<p>Most of us would agree that a life well-lived demands a life lived in balance, yet nonprofit leaders are infamously guilty of taking care of others and neglecting themselves.&nbsp; We demand efficient organizational operation while tolerating chaotic circumstances in our non-work lives.&nbsp; We mobilize a force of talented people around the mission while often remaining isolated ourselves.&nbsp; We tirelessly engage in strategic planning for the agency but give just passing thought to the trajectory of our own lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, that's a set-up for ineffective leadership.&nbsp; Set <em>your</em> autoresponder soon and ""get off the grid.""</p>

<p>Storytelling as a technique has been getting a lot of buzz in the nonprofit world. And with good reason. As Aesop discovered way back in ancient times, a well-spun tale can be an indispensable communication tool. It sends your listeners on a journey, allowing them to develop a personal connection with the issue and, as a result, sticks with them in a way that simply asserting the moral outright never could.</p>
<p>Now, substitute ""donors"" for ""listeners"" and ""mission"" for ""moral"" and you can see just how handy stories can be for cause-based organizations.</p>
<p>When crafting effective stories for nonprofits, we've found the best tales are told not just with evocative language but through smart visual design. So, this month, Big Duck is introducing an area of work we're calling <a href=""/visual_storytelling"">visual storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>What, exactly, is a visual story? Well, it can be a lot of things. Annual reports, infographics, video, PowerPoint presentations--even physical spaces--can become visual stories. The key is that, unlike the illustrations in a book of fairytales that depict a crucial moment or two, visual stories are driven from beginning to end by their imagery. The drama is woven right into the design, resulting in a story that feels that much more real and affecting.</p>
<p>Think of it as the difference between reading the Biblical account of creation and gazing up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Both share a common narrative, but the painting brings it to life with a power that takes your breath away.</p>
<p>Not that it takes a Michelangelo to create a good visual story. Here are a few of the elements we make sure to consider when we set out to spin our visual yarns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character:</strong> Stories are only compelling when we care about the individuals in them. Since most nonprofits are, at heart, about helping people, figure out who those people are and how to keep the focus on them.</li>
<li><strong>Plot:</strong> Your story needs to follow some kind of progression, with a defined conflict as well as a resolution. Think about what kind of change you're making in the world and what examples illustrate that on a specific, human level.</li>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong> Once you've got the outline of your story, give some thought to the best way to show it. After all, effective visual storytelling relies on the medium matching the message. Is it about a crisis requiring an urgent response? The immediacy of video may be the way to go. A tale of success against the odds? An infographic could be a smart choice.</li>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong> Always, always remember who your story is for. Make sure it's not only interesting but also that your audience can see how they fit in--ideally as the ones with the power to bring about more happily-ever-afters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href=""/projects/masa_israel_journey/visual_storytelling"">recent project for Masa Israel Journey</a> shows how all these elements can work together. A combination of photography, infographics, and a text-light PowerPoint presentation illustrate how spending time in Israel helps young American Jews connect to their heritage and discover their leadership potential, which ultimately benefits the entire Jewish community.</p>

<p></p>","<p>The messages coming out of the Occupy Wall Street movement are vague and incoherent. For now, I maintain that this is more to its advantage than disadvantage.</p>
<p>Let me back up just a little.</p>
<p>We haven't spent that much time discussing Occupy Wall Street at Big Duck. One strategist had a brief email rant about how maddening its lack of focus is, that it ""reflects all the worst stereotypes of the millennial generation--navel-gazing, purposeless.""</p>
<p>She's not wrong. And she cited the Occupy Wall Street mission statement as proof:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">Occupy Wall Street is leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants.</p>
<p>No ""ends"" are listed.</p>
<p>A lack of clarity on the left (of which I am admittedly a part) is also not a new problem. I've got a few years on my colleague, and this has been one of my complaints for years: ""I'm totally with you ideologically. Now can we please get our act together?"" (I usually use a crass alternative to the word <em>act</em>.)</p>
<p>Here's why I'm not sure the lack of a clear message matters all that much (at least for now): Wall Street is a convenient bogeyman. And standing up to Wall Street (whatever Wall Street is in actuality) is something pretty much all movements can get behind.</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street can therefore be all things to all people. And there's a direct (or indirect) line between the issues people are angry about and the framing device that is <em>Wall Street</em>. Examples (complete with imaginary quotes from protesting millennials!):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment</strong>. ""If rich people and corporations paid more taxes, there would be more money to create jobs.""</li>
<li><strong>Foreclosures</strong>. ""Banks, including those that received bailout funds, have foreclosed upon my grandmother.""</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>. ""Oil companies own our politicians who continue to refuse to regulate greenhouse gasses.""</li>
<li><strong>Health care</strong>. ""Insurance companies put profit above care, and people are dying because of it.""</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling, and in all of these cases, people understand that <em>Wall Street</em> stands in for rich people, corporations, banks, traders, the powerful. I'm not defending the merit of the arguments (although in most cases, I suppose I could). I'm simply pointing out how easy it is to blame <em>Wall Street</em>, no matter the issue.</p>
<p>Once you drill down to specific issues, the people Occupying Wall Street may actually disagree. Someone who believes there should be a freeze on all foreclosures may also think that eliminating all student debt is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>In the meantime, their clearest message is a negative, yet unifying, one: Down With Wall Street. A positive message hasn't yet taken form.</p>
<p>(Perhaps that's what the ""We are the 99%"" is about. I would argue that ""Occupy Wall Street"" is stronger as a message goes. And the more I write here, the bigger this topic becomes, so maybe the comparison is a post for another day.)</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street is both reminiscent and sort of the opposite of the Hope/Change theme of the 2008 Obama Campaign. The opposite because Hope/Change is a positive message. The same because Obama supporters could project whatever meaning they wanted onto Hope/Change. Whatever you think of President Obama, most of us would probably agree that Hope/Change was an effective campaign message.</p>
<p>So yes, Occupy Wall Street's lack of coherent messaging may frustrate some of us, even those of us sympathetic to the overall cause (whatever it is!). But more and more people are heading down to Wall Street every day, and you don't get masses like this if the word isn't somehow getting out and working.</p>
<p>Heck, they're even <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=269157873118419"" target=""_blank"">hosting Yom Kippur service</a> in Zuccotti Park. (I have to admit that I kind of like the Fiddler on the Wall Street Bull.)</p>
<p>Finally, a warning for nonprofiteers...</p>
<p>A mass movement approach--i.e. vague platitudes, unclear goals, and general inspiration--to communications almost certainly won't work for you. Most nonprofits do specific work on specific issues. Inspiring donations and activism on behalf of your organization requires more than generalities.</p>
<p>You still need to define your positioning and personality, get clear about your audiences, and hit them with some specific urgency to get them to take action.</p>
<p>But back to Occupy Wall Street, what's next? Who knows? Eventually, they'll probably need to define their aims a bit more clearly.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more realistically, after feeding on each other's energy for inspiration, the individual issue movements will splinter off and keep up the momentum, clarifying their messaging for their specific audiences. That would be the ideal anyway.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this whole Occupy Wall Street thing is really something. I may not know what, exactly, but it really is something.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1,1408%2,1409%3","","","","the_communications_of_occupy_wall_street","positioning personality Occupy-Wall-Street mission-statement messaging goals","","<p><small>Photo courtesy of TalkingPointsMemo.com</small></p>",

So Steve Jobs' death struck a particular chord for me, and I found myself rewatching some of his incredible presentations over the past few years last week.</p>","<p>I'm a hardcore Mac user- in fact, I've never owned or worked on PC. So Steve Jobs' death struck a particular chord for me, and I found myself rewatching some of his incredible presentations over the past few years last week.</p>
<p>Those videos got me wondering: Why is it that some people seem to magically transform the dullest content on earth into the most brilliant thing you've ever heard, while other meetings and presentations feel like a form of torture? Increasingly, I'm convinced that knowing your content is only a small part of what it takes to give a kick-ass presentation. Sure, presentation skills count too, but in this era where Blackberries and laptops are always just a fingertip's reach away, you've got to be especially dazzling.</p>
<p>Luckily, the nonprofit sector has some terrific speakers too. Ever hear <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/"" target=""_blank"">Katya Andresen</a> from Network for Good or <a href=""http://www.madelinestanionis.com/"" target=""_blank"">Madeline Staniosis</a> from Watershed throw down? They (and many others) could teach us all a thing or two about making our board meetings, donor presentations, or other group discussions more engaging. Here are a few tricks I've picked up from them and (painfully) through my own trial and error.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare to have fun.</strong> Taking the time to come up with an overarching theme and express it with slides that are image-intensive helps you avoid the tedium of text-only and forces your audiences to actually listen to what you're saying. Katya weaves everything from the Simpsons to Oprah Winfrey into her talks, making complex information that could be a snore into something memorable. Take a look at <a href=""http://inspirationfeed.com/inspiration/typography-inspiration/55-inspiring-quotations-that-will-change-the-way-you-think/"" target=""_blank"">these inspirations</a> to get a few ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Say it in pictures.</strong> Please, spare us the slides packed with bullets. And don't even think about reading them to me. Slides should illustrate what you're saying- that means using photos, illustrations, data visualizations, videos, or even just a key word or two to drive your spoken point home. Steve Jobs and Al Gore are both masters at this. Watch a few minutes of Steve Job's <a href=""http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2011/"" target=""_blank"">presentations</a> to see what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage them to talk back.</strong> Ask you audience questions along the way to keep them awake and engaged. For instance, before you share data ask your audience, ask question that sparks a brief discussion, then answer that question with your results. They'll buy-in to your content more if they feel they've been asked their opinion and have given the matter a bit of thought.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me a story</strong>. Invite a client or new donor to come and share their personal story for the first 5 minutes of the board meeting. Sprinkle quotes and images from supporters throughout your presentation. Share a video made by an activist who's passionate about your issues. By telling real stories about real humans sparks passion and commitment; it's particularly important if some of the content you're delivering is dry (financials, anyone?).</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for complete technical failure.</strong> Some of the best presentations disintegrate when the laptop dies. Be ready for anything by bringing back ups of your content as many ways as you can, but be prepared to go it alone (eg with no PowerPoint or other equipment) in a pinch. Just printing out a few black and white copies can save the day, so don't let technical failures derail you. Remember that your audience wants to hear you deliver your content with confidence- not complain about the projector.</p>
<p><strong>Control the room.</strong> Get there early and make sure everything's working so you can avoid technical failure- or at least have some time to fix anything that comes up. Think about how you want the chairs and tables arranged, where you'll stand or sit, if the temperature is comfortable, and other details that can impact how focused you or your audience might be. Think of yourself as Lady Gaga and that board room is Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>In a blind (and pucker-inducing) tasting, each contender was rated on looks, taste, and crunch. A vinegary tang filled the air as we made our appraisals--too sweet? Too salty? A little limp? After a good thirty minutes of munching (and not a few unprintable pickle jokes) the final scores were tallied. And the winner? Perhaps not the pickle you predicted. Although the sweet-ish zing of Divine Brine's Devilish Dills seemed like the crowd favorite--so much that we Tweeted their triumph--when the math was done, the Paragon of Pungency, Dominator of the Dills, and Greatest of the Gherkins turned out to be from...Front Street Pizza. Yep, that's right. According to the numbers, the no-frills lunch joint across the street is the proud purveyor of a near-perfect pickle.</p>

<p>Imagine choreographing your nonprofit's mission. What are the key points you'd need to communicate? How would you make it clear, simple, and easy to understand?</p>
<p>Your organization's work is important and often complicated--it can be challenging to find the right words and avoid jargon. So why not start by finding the right dance moves instead?

She used the time to visit her family in Scotland. I held down the fort here in New York and didn't go with her. It wasn't great. Turns out, we prefer being on the same continent. So this past August, I arranged to go with her and work from abroad.</p>","<p>Back in 2010, like many therapists, my wife took off the month of August. She used the time to visit her family in Scotland. I held down the fort here in New York and didn't go with her. It wasn't great. Turns out, we prefer being on the same continent. So this past August, I arranged to go with her and work from abroad.</p>
<p>Working offsite for a month doesn't necessarily work for all jobs, of course, but with the advances in technology, it might be more possible than you think. Here are a few things required for it to be possible:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><strong>A supportive team.</strong><br />First of all, the boss has to approve of the idea. Then, you'll need to work with your colleagues to put some systems in place for collaborating with new hurdles.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">In my case, we were talking about a five-hour time difference. Calls, meetings, instant messaging, and emails for immediate reply needed to happen in the morning for my colleagues. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to respond until the following day.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><strong>High-speed internet.</strong><br />Skyping and file sharing aren't possible without it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">My father-in-law actually lives in a small town in the Highlands of Scotland, and I had some lingering doubts about whether he had the technology I'd need. He assured me that he had a high-speed cable connection. We were surprised, as was he, to discover that he also had wireless. And it was faster that what we have in New York.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><strong>Emergency backup.</strong><br />""911, what's your emergency?""</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">""I need some copy! Stat!""</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">You can never predict when you'll have a sudden copy emergency. So we had a terrific freelancer standing by in case something immediate came up. Big Duck is also fortunate to have a couple of excellent writers on the non-writing teams. Would you believe me if I told you I sometimes ask one of our designers grammar questions?</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;""><strong>A few days off, too.</strong><br />If you're going to be off-site, especially if you're some place beautiful, be sure to take a few days to yourself as well. Regenerate a bit.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .5in;"">Frankly, I could've done this part better. I didn't even take a proper walk in the Highlands. I'm a Mets fan, though, so I'm quite used to saying, ""Just wait until next year!""</p>
<p>This was the first time we'd tried this arrangement, and we had a couple of minor hiccups along the way (including a lousy phone line for a client call). But we didn't have any deal-breakers (at least not anything anyone's mentioned to me yet). And I anticipate that it'll go even more smoothly next year.</p>
<p>So maybe it's time to look into a change of scenery for a little while. It can certainly keep you and your work fresh, of course. But you may discover some unexpected benefits of working off-site, too.</p>
<p>The big one for me was that, thanks to the time difference, I had a good chunk of time every day to work on my various projects without other distractions from the office. When do we ever get five hours of uninterrupted time? I had it nearly every day for the entire month. What a luxury!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1416%1,18910%2","","","","working_with_a_time_difference","Around-the-office working-remote copywriting","","",

While others make vacation plans, I work with my colleagues to devise exciting integrated fundraising campaigns for nonprofit organizations. <a href=""http://www1.networkforgood.org/online-giving-study-donations-driven-donor-experience-year-end-gifts-and-large-scale-disasters"" target=""_blank"">Study</a> after <a href=""http://www.e-benchmarksstudy.com/"" target=""_blank"">study</a> shows how most nonprofits see their biggest influx of donations--especially those that come in via email/web/social media--during the last few months, if not days, of the year.</p>
<p>Fellow Big Duck strategist, Rachel Hope Allison, and I have focused on developing online fundraising strategies and campaigns for over ten years. With that experience in hand, along with previous training in direct mail and telemarketing programs for nonprofits, we've developed a handy list of twelve ingredients for successful multi-channel or integrated fundraising campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>1. Identify and prioritize your goals.</strong><br />Your primary goal is probably to raise money, but think about how your campaign might also help you build relationships with your supporters and grow your email list.</p>
<p><strong>2. Find the biggest news in your space.</strong><br />What's happening in the world as it relates to your mission? Look for ways to hook your work into news that your donors and wider community may have heard about.</p>
<p><strong>3. Connect it to your organization's short-term goals.</strong><br />What strategies or approaches does your organization take to make things happen? What are your current approaches to accomplish your mission?</p>
<p><strong>4. Find the specific problem this news can help you solve.</strong><br />It can help donors relate to your work if you can establish the need for their support. Even better if you can frame your work as the solution to the problem you are addressing.</p>
<p><strong>5. Set an achievable goal for how you'll solve it.</strong><br />More than just explaining how you'll solve the problem, determine a goal for what you want to accomplish so that donors can feel like they are having an impact on the solution.</p>
<p><strong>6. Select the right channels to reach your audiences.</strong><br />Take a moment to pause and think like one of your donors. Now think about where they go to get information about the issues you are working on. Do they open every email? 'Like' every Facebook status update? Visit your website every week to see what's new?</p>
<p><strong>7. Craft your calendar around deadlines.</strong><br />Most year-end campaigns start around Thanksgiving and go through early January. Set up a calendar that allows your messages to tell a compelling, coordinated, and cohesive story.</p>
<p><strong>8. Reflect your organization's tone and style.</strong><br />Have you identified your overall brand personality and applied it to your materials? Is your organization nurturing and supportive, or more aggressive and bold? Anchor your campaign in who you are.</p>
<p><strong>9. Focus each message on one call to action.</strong><br />The more simple and direct your ask--from giving to taking action--the more likely it is that someone will do it.</p>
<p><strong>10. Tell the same story in all elements.</strong><br />Remember what I said bout being consistent before? Just when things start feeling boring to you, your community will start to 'get it'.</p>
<p><strong>11. Report back to your audience on impact.</strong><br />It shocks me how many campaigns I see that forget to say thank you at the end and let people know what happened. Even if people didn't give, they like to feel part of the success. And your words of thanks may warm them up for the next time, not to mention make those who did give feel even better about it.</p>
<p><strong>12. Analyze the results to inform the next campaign.</strong><br />How did your campaign compare to the last one you did? How does it compare to other nonprofits? Take time to measure performance and response rates and jot out lessons learned to apply to the next campaign.</p>

Our first office was my living room, and my only employee was a black Labrador Retreiver puppy named Trout. When Trout wasn't busy chewing up my shoes, she gave me someone to talk to and entertained visiting clients.

Our first office was my living room, and my only employee was a black Labrador Retreiver puppy named Trout. When Trout wasn't busy chewing up my shoes, she gave me someone to talk to and entertained visiting clients. In the early 90s, nonprofits didn't think much about the web, and the work I did was largely print-based. I sometimes used pencils when working, and very few of my clients had email or a fax.</p>
<p>Not including that living room, Big Duck has had 4 other offices over the past seventeen years. &nbsp;We've grown to over a dozen people on staff, even more laptops, and a bucket full of cloud-based technology. Just about everything we do these days exists predominantly online, and I suspect I haven't owned a pencil in years.</p>
<p>In 2006, when we moved into the space we're vacating, the communications landscape looked very different for nonprofits. Many small and mid-sized orgs were still trying to build a servicable website, and most of them relied on proprietary systems, Dreamweaver, or hard-coded HTML sites. Print was still a critical way to reach donors, and secure, online donation processing wasn't that common. Unless you're a real techie, you probably didn't know what 'open source' was back in 2006, much less Facebook. If you did, neither was factored seriously into your nonprofit's communications strategy.</p>
<p>As bittersweet as leaving this office might feel after 5 terrific years, I'm exhilarated by what's to come. Our new office will be considerably larger, with a training room we'll use to give workshops and do other communications-related capacity-building work. Our staff is growing as we help nonprofits raise more and more money and increase their ability to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>It's even more exciting to think of the change that's likely coming in the work we all do. In another 5 years, where will the nonprofit sector be? Will we still largely communicate online or will everything be mobile and PDA-based? Will we even talk about 'the cloud' or will it be like talking about breathing air? &nbsp;I'm not good at making predications, and I suspect it's anyone's guess what the winds of technology will bring. But I'm definitely excited to dive in and ready for the future.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","moving_on_to_a_bigger_pond","Around-the-office nptech nonprofit-communications moving Big-Duck","","<p><small>Photo credit: bigstockimages.com</small></p>",

Five tips for managing updates to your communications","","20153","","<p>Change is hard. And we don't just mean big, societal, eradicate-poverty-and-hunger kind of change. Making changes to your organization's communications is difficult, too.</p>

And we don't just mean big, societal, eradicate-poverty-and-hunger kind of change. Making changes to your organization's communications is difficult, too.</p>
<p>Even seemingly small changes (like creating a new brochure) and positive changes (like developing a new brand that will help your nonprofit raise money and visibility more effectively) can be tricky and frustrating.</p>
<p>Just when you're putting the finishing touches to that brochure, a chorus of voices asks whether it's actually necessary. You roll out your new brand but people keep producing materials using the old one.</p>
<p>So what can you do to avoid those situations and make your efforts as high-impact as possible?</p>
<p>The following strategies work no matter what kind of change you're involved in--whether it's a shift in your communications culture, a relocation, or something even bigger, like a change in your nonprofit's mission.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be clear about what it is you're really trying to change.</strong><br /> Before you start to make changes, think carefully about what you're hoping to achieve and whether the change you're about to make really is the right way to get there.<br /><br /> For example, if you're struggling to explain your organization clearly to your audiences, it's tempting to create new materials that explain things better. But if you're having a hard time explaining yourself, chances are you need to change your messaging, not just your materials.<br /><br /> Focus on why you need to change things before thinking about what you need to change. Start by writing a project brief that identifies your goals, the audiences you're trying to reach, and the measurable results you want to achieve. Once you've done that, you're ready to start thinking about what you need to change to get there.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</strong><br /> Don't change things just for the sake of change. Before you embark on any project to change your communications, big or small, make sure you have solid strategic reasons for doing so. Take a step back and ask yourself whether the change you're proposing will really help you achieve your communication goals.<br /><br /> Conduct some informal research--like an online survey, interviews, or informal focus groups with your supporters--to find out whether your communications are doing what they need to. If the answer's no, it's probably time for a change. But if the answer's yes, you might be better off directing your time, energy, and budget elsewhere.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""3""><strong>Involve people early on.</strong><br /> Most people don't like change--particularly when they feel it's being imposed on them. So we Ducks recommend that our clients involve key staff--usually people who will be most affected by the change--early on in each project we work on.<br /><br /> Letting people have a say at the start helps them feel part of the change, which builds buy-in and is critical to the success of any change effort. As the project progresses, you probably won't need to hear from all of those key people at every stage. But it's important to update them on progress every once in a while, to keep them engaged and to avoid any nasty surprises.<br /><br /> Use regular existing meetings--like department, staff, and board meetings--to share progress with people without clogging up their calendar.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li value=""4""><strong>Make sure everyone's on the same page.</strong><br />Does everyone agree that the changes you want to make are necessary? It's important to make sure that everyone's aligned on the need for change before you start making any adjustments to your communications.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;""><br />The positive momentum you get when everyone's on board helps you ride out any bumps that might pop up along the way. Consensus on the need for change also allows you to devote more of your energy to pushing the project forward instead of trying to convince the skeptics that you're doing the right thing.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.25in;"">Our <a href=""http://Link%20to%20http//www.bigducknyc.com/resources/scorecard"" target=""_blank"">brandraising scorecard</a> can help you understand if people agree about where your communications could be improved. Ask a few key people to take the scorecard, then sit down together to compare results. If your scores are similar, now might be a good time to consider making some changes.</p>
<ol>
<li value=""5""><strong>Expect the unexpected.</strong><br /> Change of any kind almost always takes longer than you think it will and involves unexpected pauses and changes in direction. If you go into a project expecting to make unplanned adjustments and knowing where you can and can't be flexible, those adjustments will be much less disruptive.<br /><br /> A good project brief and detailed calendar that lay out all the essentials and key dates for a project are great tools for keeping things on track in the face of the unexpected.</li>

<p>The name 'Rabbit Movers', is fine. It conveys fast, which I suppose is a good thing in a moving company, right? The name on its own doesn't knock your socks off, necessarily, but that's ok because other elements of the system help you get there. For instance, the tagline 'truckin like bunnies' conveys that not only are they fast, they also have a sense of humor. Now I'm thinking I might even like these people- and perhaps trust them. They are starting to feel humor. They go even further with the 888-WABBIT phone number (perhaps it's too cute?) and now they've really got my attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bullets under the name tell me exactly what they do, so there's no guesswork if my job is a good fit for them. Thanks for making my life easier, Rabbit Movers. There's an easy-to-remember phone number, a clear URL, and they've even translated the 888 number into regular digits for those people who really want to get down to business and pick up the phone. This is a great example of being audience-centric: remembering who your audience is, what they might want, and giving it to them straight up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big, graphic bunny feels dynamic and hip- not cute or demure, reinforcing the messages of the tagline farther. I love that they chose eye-popping bright blue on brown for the contrasting colors, and skillfully avoided bunny clich</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1408%1,2059%2,1409%3","","","","think_in_systems","Personality Experiential-communications tagline messaging consistency audience","","",

Give them pizza and/or coffee and you'll find most people will do just about anything for two hours.</p>","<p>Gotta come up with something smart and creative pronto? Consider jumpstarting your project and building buy-in by having a brainstorming session. You can invite staff, board members, volunteers--anyone who'll help you think up solutions that might work. Give them pizza and/or coffee and you'll find most people will do just about anything for two hours.</p>
<p>Much of the work we do at Big Duck involves generating smart, creative solutions to challenges where there is typically less time and even less money than anyone having to deliver results would like. Over the years, we've found that the smaller the box, the more inventive the solution might actually be- but often it takes a few people working collaboratively to tease out the best results.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/-1_1.jpg"" style=""width: 534px; height: 250px;"" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips I've found help.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Before you brainstorm, brief.</strong> Don't expect people to show up for a meeting, hear about something for the first time, and have great ideas immediately. Some people are more able to spontaneously generate ideas (often, the visionaries, entrepreneurs, and big-mouths), but many others need time to think things over before their ideas start to flow. Giving all the participants a brief (written or verbal) a week before the brainstorming session can help them wrap their heads around it and prepare notes or ideas in advance if they'd like.</li>
<li><strong>No such thing as a bad idea.</strong> When one person enthusiastically puts their gem-like idea out to the group only to have it immediately crushed to dust they won't be likely to volunteer again soon, and the momentum gets killed fast. At the start of your meeting, remind everyone that the goal is to generate solutions, not shoot down ideas like a trigger-happy hunter. Set a period of time when you'll be in idea-generating mode, then switch (deliberately) into review mode to sort through the ideas and see what rises to the top.</li>
<li><strong>Write on the walls.</strong> Our office is painted with <a href=""http://www.ideapaint.com/"" target=""_blank"">IdeaPaint</a>, so we can literally write on the walls. Noting comments, even drawing them, helps people connect visually and build on each other's ideas.&nbsp; If your walls are less fancy than ours, try taping big sheets of white paper up on the wall, using a dry erase board, or investing in those giant sticky-note pads. Give yourself as much surface space as you can so your ideas aren't stunted by the limitations of real estate.</li>
<li><strong>End with a good recap.</strong> Turning your ideas into an actionable plan requires good project management skills. Consider typing up your raw notes or photographing them for reference, then sending an email summarizing the key takeaways to all participants. Be sure to identify next steps, who's responsible, and any budget or timing variables that should be noted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not brainstorming in a group? Consider using Mind Mapping software or good old fashioned doodling to explore ideas intuitively and see what you come up with. I'm a fan of <a href=""http://www.accidentalcreative.com/store/paper/pip-the-personal-idea-pad"" target=""_blank"">PIP</a> for old-school thinking on paper, too.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","18910%1","","","","getting_the_best_from_brainstorming","Around-the-office recap ideas fun creativity collaboration brainstorming","","",

<p><strong>1. Make it easy and compelling for donors to support you online.</strong><br /> As much as we love a good scavenger hunt, finding where to donate on your site should be both clear and compelling. Your donation page should be easy to find, but slapping a ""Donate Now"" button everywhere isn't the whole answer. <a href=""/making_the_most_of_an_online_first_impression""> The path to the donate page also needs to warm donors up.</a> Your buttons and web copy should quickly explain why they need to give--make donors feel like their donations matter and will help move your organization's mission forward. Once they get to the donation page, intro copy should quickly reinforce the case for giving, then make the process of donating as simple as possible. Ask only for the information you need and remove any unnecessary form fields or distracting links. If you haven't done it in awhile, try making a gift today to your nonprofit and two others your supporters are likely to give to. How do the experiences compare?<br /><br /><strong> 2. Build relationships with donors through integrated campaigns.</strong><br /> An integrated campaign is one that features a clear theme or story across multiple communications channels (email, social media, website, video, mail, phone, in-person event, etc.). These campaigns usually engage supporters beyond donating--with actions that range from sharing personal stories to signing petitions to passing the campaign on to personal networks. Sophisticated nonprofits execute these multichannel campaigns several times a year, not just from November to January. If you are looking for ways to do more of these in 2012, <a href=""/contentmgr/blog/12_ways_you_can_make_your_campaign_stronger"" target=""_blank""> take a look at these twelve tips</a>.<br /><br /><strong> 3. Find your most passionate donors and turn them into fundraisers.</strong><br /> Pause for a moment and think about what groups you donated to over the past year or two. We'd bet there is at least one organization you supported because a friend, family member, or colleague asked you to. From walkathons and marathons to birthdays and tributes, it's become the norm to give to the causes your friends and family care about (even when that cause may not be as high a priority for yourself). Is your organization making that kind of social giving easy? Have you asked your super donors--the ones who give almost every time you ask, even in small amounts--to enlist the help of their friends via email and social media? There are lots of tools that make this simple and easy to do, including Causes on Facebook, Crowdrise, Razoo, and HelpAttack! <a href=""http://www.razoo.com/giving_catalog#first=0&amp;kw=NON-PROFIT+TECHNOLOGY+ENTERPRISE+NETWORK+aka+NTEN&amp;rg=&amp;st=&amp;widgetScope=on"" target=""_blank"">Here's a current campaign from the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN) that shows how this works</a>.<br /><br /><strong> 4. Create community and give donors more ways to support you.</strong><br /> We've been talking about generating financial support in this article, but have you also thought about ways your communications can spark other kinds of support? When you get donors to come to an event, watch a video, share a photo, or even retweet or ""like"" a status update, they'll be much more motivated to donate in the future. They may even feel good about meeting and interacting with other supporters who also believe in your work. So, make a resolution to be more of a yenta (a.k.a. matchmaker) in 2012 and introduce your donors, activists, and other community members to each other.</p>

I'd love to hear what they think about recent changes we've made in certain departments, what processes or systems could use updating, what would make their teams function better, and so on. There are people I'm fortunate to work with at Big Duck who's brains I'd like to pick on a wide array of professional and personal topics- everything from farming to software to how we work together. &nbsp;But day-to-day office life doesn't always leave much room for conversations that aren't specifically about moving today's priority projects forward. That's what retreats are for.</p>
<p>So, armed with few digital devices (a sort of 'trust fall' for most of us), down coats, and deep thoughts, the staff of Big Duck left Brooklyn Sunday night for our first-ever overnight retreat. Our two days at the <a href=""http://isabellafreedman.org/"" target=""_blank"">Isabella Freedman Center</a> in Connecticut were terrific: great food, warm fires, cozy rooms, and productive time spent discussing things we often don't make enough time for.</p>
<p>Seeing each other in a new context is good stuff, and I think my fellow Ducks would agree that our conversations were an investment in the health of our collective relationship.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/img_0248.jpg"" style=""width: 284px; height: 379px;"" /></p>
<p>Why have an offsite retreat for more than a day? Because immersion in a new context helps people face new situations on equal footing, so the usual types of hierarchy get upset, and great things happen. Maybe the most junior person becomes the leader of a hike or the person who can be reliably content to prepare a great fire. It's inspiring and refreshing to see each other in new ways- and opens doors to ways we might work together differently. It's also valuable to be in a place where you can build in walks, breaks, and time spent in daylight-filled rooms with views, not just the back room of a hotel or a restaurant. Most of all, making time for those conversations that are at the heart of your office culture can be an invaluable way to boost commitment, productivity and passion for the work itself.</p>
<p>By the end of our 48 hours together, we'd resolved lingering questions, aired hidden frustrations, and collectively envisioned some pretty exciting stuff. Go pack your bags.</p>

<p>Organizational values are important. It's the stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning and keeps you moving on the crazy days. They define what's important to you and what you believe in as a company. Your name, your logo, even your mission might change, but your values, at the core, usually stay the same.</p>
<p>Every nonprofit has values. If you articulate them in a clear, public-facing values statement, they become a powerful tool that you can use in lots of ways, like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating to donors, clients, and others what you're about</li>
<li>Motivating and inspiring your staff and board</li>
<li>Evaluating potential new hires</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organization hasn't written a values statement yet, we recommend it. Start by carving out a chunk of time at the end of your next staff meeting to start a brainstorm. You'll hear lots of interesting thoughts about what makes your organization tick, and perhaps you'll discover that you're all on the same page about what's really important.</p>
<p>Intrigued? Here are a few examples and resources:</p>
<ul>

I messed around with it aimlessly for two hours even though I didn't have a single other contact; a pretty good sign.<br /><br />If you typically interact with Facebook on your smart phone, you'll know that the experience leaves a bit to be desired. It's slow to update, posts comments to the wrong photos, and struggles to cram in all of its web features into your tiny smart phone window.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/627e4b538de31a34e50942ece94b6b0f/files/path_screen.jpg"" width=""334"" height=""480"" /></p>
<p>Path on the other hand, is minimal and smart looking, designed to be used only on your smart phone. While Facebook and Google+ have struggled with who you share what with, Path allows you only 150 contacts. Forget groups and privacy filters, by default you've only got your inner circle to share with. It's a pretty great solution and perhaps re-defines what it is to ""be friends"" on the internet. Again.<br /><br />Path explains,""We are inspired by Professor Robin Dunbar from Oxford University, whose research delves deeply into the number of trusted relationships humans can maintain throughout life. We tend to have 5 best friends, 15 good friends, 50 close friends and family, and 150 total friends. At Path, we're building tools for you to share with the people who matter most in your life.""</p>
<p>Of course the question it raises for marketers is ""how can organizations be a relevant part of this tighter circle?"" Does anyone want to be <i>inner circle</i> friends with an organization? We'll be keeping a close eye on that.</p>

<p>But thanks to the wonders of the Internet and phones, you can do more than just bite your fingernails and hope.</p>
<p>If you're monitoring your year-end returns and think they need one last little nudge, consider these ways to boost your fundraising fast.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resend or forward your last appeal.</strong> With so much riding on Dec 29, 30 and 31, you should do whatever you can to send at least one email appeal in this window. If you don't have an email appeal set to launch already, consider resending your last email appeal to all your list members who haven't already given. With email open rates typically at 20% or less, your resend will help reach donors who missed your email the first time, and act as a reminder to those who opened but didn't give. Want to do more than just a resend? Consider forwarding your last email appeal with a note above it, reminding people that the tax-deductible giving deadline is coming soon and they still have a chance to help support your mission with a gift.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Post to Facebook with a picture.</strong> Facebook posts that feature a photo typically generate more likes and comments. So before the New Year, try posting a photo with a gentle reminder that you still have time to make your tax-deductible gift and a link to the giving page. But remember, Facebook is primarily a space for sharing stories and updates, not fundraising. So try to make your post friendly and fun to read, not just a dry request for donations. Consider a holiday photo of your organization's staff with a ""Happy New Year!"" sign, a piece of artwork generated by your community, or an inspiring picture of the people, animals or places your organization supports.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tweet about the deadline.</strong> Have an active Twitter following? Send a tweet reminding your followers that you need their help before the deadline, and linking to the donation page. If you have a year-end fundraising goal, you might consider updating your followers on your progress so far and urging them to help you make the goal in the next few days. As for your phrasing, try to make your tweet feel as personally engaging as possible by using the words ""I"" and/or ""you,"" and wording your tweet as a direct question.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your homepage has a prominent link to give. </strong>The measure of your social media and email outreach isn't just the number of direct clicks it generates to the donation page--by keeping your organization top-of-mind for your supporters, it will likely generate visits to your homepage as well. So make sure your website visitors see a quick and easy way to make their year-end gift by placing a prominent link to give near the top of your homepage. If you have a slideshow, consider dedicating one slide to year-end giving. If not, place a graphic button somewhere on your homepage. And remember, a simple ""Donate"" button is not enough. Be sure to include the words ""year-end,"" ""tax-deductible,"" and ""deadline"" in the text on your homepage slide, promotion, or graphic.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make a few calls.</strong> The Internet is amazing, but it's not the only real-time medium you can use to boost year-end giving. Consider reaching out to a select number of existing donors with a phone call. Make your reminder gentle. Thank them for their support so far, tell them what exciting new work is on the horizon, then remind them that--if they haven't given already--there's still time to give before the tax-deductible giving deadline. Even if they don't commit to a gift on the phone, these donors will feel like you're paying attention to them, and might just visit your website to make a gift later.</li>

<p><strong>You get check ups--shouldn't your communications?</strong> As these lean fundraising years continue, more organizations are using their visual identities, messaging platforms, and day-to-day communications to express their value. Organizations who've proactively invested in their own branding are making the most of it by reviewing what they're doing and tweaking where appropriate. The beginning of a new year is a great time to lay all of your materials out on a table and talk about what's working and what's not. <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/brand_check_up"" target=""_blank"">Read up here on how other organizations perform brand check ups.</a><br /><br /><strong> Integrated, multichannel campaigns are becoming the rule, not the exception.</strong> Email and social media are real, viable fundraising tools. There's no denying it. Organizations of all shapes and sizes are increasingly launching campaigns that weave email, mail, social media, your website, and perhaps even mobile or video into a cohesive narrative arc, and are seeing great results. If you know you need to go there but don't know where to start, take a look at <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/12_ways_you_can_make_your_campaign_stronger"" target=""_blank"">12 ways you can make your campaign stronger</a> or dig into this <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/flex_your_multichannel_muscles"" target=""_blank"">robust collection of resources</a>.<br /><br /> <strong>Just as the middle class in America is disappearing, so too are mid-level websites.</strong> Websites these days are increasingly either down-and-dirty, simple, and low-cost, or they're fancy, highly interactive experiences built with the help of user personas, card sorting, testing, robust content management and constituent relationship management systems, and other useful tools to ensure an optimal experience. Want the latest technology online? Build it into your budget now.

It helps if you can <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/embedding_communicators_in_your_nonprofit"" target=""_blank"">embed communicators throughout your nonprofit</a>, and it's critical that your leadership sets a tone that encourages a culture that supports clear communications. <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/it/products/research/media_products/social_org/assessment.jsp"" target=""_blank"">Gartner's Social Readiness Assessment</a> will help you determine if your leader's attitude to social media is folly, fearful, flippant, formulating, forging, or fusing, and might offer some insights on how you can move towards progress.<br /><br /> <em>What are your highlights from 2011 or predictions for 2012?

So if there are words we don't like because they're overused or seemingly meaningless or jargonically nonsensical, we can usually avoid them. It's also a great language for making up words, such as <em>jargonical</em>.</p>
<p>And although there are words I avoid (or try to avoid, anyway), I'm a writer. I want a full arsenal of words available to me. In general, I don't like blacklisting words.</p>
<p>So with that caveat (to go along with the caveats expressed in the <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/words-nonprofits-avoid-2010"" target=""_blank"">2010</a> and <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/words-avoid-2011-edition"" target=""_blank"">2011</a>&nbsp;Words to Avoid posts), I offer you the 2012 Big Duck list of words that nonprofits should avoid (or at least think twice about using).</p>
<p><strong>Ask (as a noun)</strong><br />In the nonprofit world, we spend a lot of time asking for things from people. Especially when it comes time to ask for money (say, in a direct mail or email appeal), we have best practices (see below) and guidelines to follow. A direct mail appeal, for example, should include four asks. As you develop your letter, it's fine to talk about the asks in terms of ""asks."" But let's not let that word slip into the letter itself. It's an insider's view of raising money. <em>Asks</em> (as a noun) isn't a word used in most people's lives. <em>Ask</em> (as a verb) doesn't carry the same insider baggage.</p>
<p><strong>Best practices</strong><br />I hope you pay attention to the best practices in your area of work. At Big Duck, we spend a lot of time talking about and debating best practices. So this is another term that's totally fine in some contexts, especially in your internal meetings. But once you use <em>best practices</em> to communicate with your audiences, you isolate them. <em>Best practices</em> is just another insider way of talking about things. And you immediately exclude the people you most want to include.</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong><br />There's nothing really wrong with this word, but I submit <em>issue</em> because it's sometimes used as a softer term for <em>problem</em>. I wish we could all just admit that we've got big problems in this world, and our nonprofit organizations are here to address them. Issues are eternal and general. Problems are more specific and urgent. So <em>human rights</em> might be your issue, and it's an ongoing struggle. But <em>people dying</em>--that's a real problem that needs to be taken care of immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Occupy</strong><br />I don't know when nonprofits might need this word, but you never know. You can probably guess why you should avoid it--the Occupy Movement pretty much owns the word right now.</p>
<p><strong>Resonate</strong><br />We've been hearing a lot of misuse of this word lately: ""I resonate with that."" Perhaps you <em>relate</em> to that. Or maybe it resonates with <em>you</em>. But generally speaking, you don't resonate with something.</p>
<p><strong>Thought-leader</strong><br />I guess it's just not enough to be a leader anymore. Maybe <em>thought-leader</em> is meant to be a more specific term. But I'm not sure I've ever seen or heard <em>thought-leader</em> in a context where it couldn't be put in better terms. Also, it's another example of language you might use internally seeping out into the language you use for your external audiences. At Big Duck, we talk about wanting to be considered thought-leaders within the nonprofit communications field, but we try to keep that talk internal. In fact, by using <em>thought-leader</em> five times in this section, I've increased our public usage by 250%. You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Moist</strong><br />As I was asking around the office for suggestions on words to avoid, <em>moist</em> was the most frequent, independently mentioned term that came up. Which is particularly funny because my colleagues know that I was asking for their thoughts for the Duck Call blog, which is about nonprofit communications. But there you go: the Ducks, in general, recommend avoiding the word <em>moist</em> because it skeeves out some of us. I personally don't mind the word <em>moist</em> because it reminds me of my brother-in-law's carrot cake. I have never met its equal.</p>
<p><strong>A special comment about <em>impact</em></strong><br />I'm not ready to throw in the towel on this one yet. I understand the appeal of <em>impact</em>, especially for nonprofits. It says that you're accomplishing goals, something funders want. It's a short word. It's even vaguely onomatopoetic. Bam! Impact!</p>
<p>I just think you probably have better options available to you, something that doesn't have the implications of impacted wisdom teeth or an asteroid hitting the earth. We're the nonprofit world: we want to move people in our communications. <em>Impact</em> is a hard word (not difficult, but physically hard). I don't doubt that there are organizations for which <em>impact</em> is a terrific word to use. But think about whether it's really better than something more specific to your mission and the people you serve. I'd much rather hear that you helped Jimmy breathe better than hear that you had a giant impact on Jimmy.</p>
<p>And, by the way, we're not immune to <em>impact</em> ourselves. It's one of Big Duck's <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/values"" target=""_blank"">values</a>. And although I concur with what follows the word in our description, it's one of my resolutions for 2012 to come up with an alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br />As usual, I asked my colleagues for suggestions and also did a bit of research along the way. The <a href=""http://www.lssu.edu/banished/current.php"" target=""_blank"">Lake Superior State University's annual list of banished words</a>&nbsp;is always a pleasure. I especially like the introductory paragraph about <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>I was also pleased to find the <a href=""http://www.lssu.edu/banished/complete_list.php"" target=""_blank"">LSSU's complete list of banished words</a>, which goes all the way back to 1976. The entry for <a href=""http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/1982.php"" target=""_blank""><em>Alexander Haig</em></a>&nbsp;is hilarious and weird. Caspar Weinberger, alas, gets no such treatment.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1409%1,1416%2","","","","words_to_avoid_2012_edition","words-to-avoid messaging Impact copywriting copy","messaging","",

I'm talking about screen-filling visual goodness taking over your browser window. Why would anyone do such a thing?</p>","<p>For a while now I've been looking to employ a nifty little trick in web design: the use of browser-filling imagery to impress. I'm talking about screen-filling visual goodness taking over your browser window. Why would anyone do such a thing?</p>
<p>The more we share photos and watch TV and movies online, the more we get used to having immersive visual experiences on the web. Users are coming to expect not just information but an experience from the websites they visit.</p>
<p>Take the <a href=""http://www.callofduty.com/"" target=""_blank"">website for the Call of Duty video game</a>&nbsp;for example. (Don't judge me for loving this). See how juicy and rich that image is? Feel like you're in battle yet? Pretty great right? We should totally play video games right now. The large image mimics the experience of playing the game. It's a large-scale promotion for a very large scale, experience-rich product.</p>
<p>It used to be that we'd have to fit our designs into a fairly small space so that folks like my dear mother could view it on an outmoded computer with a small monitor and an old browser. (Hi Mom!) With newer, larger monitors the restrictions are loosening. And now that my mom actually has a nicer computer than I do, it's safer than ever to start pushing those larger designs!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.seamless.com/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Seamless.com screen shot"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/seamless.jpg"" style=""width: 534px; height: 322px;"" /></a><br /><small>Another example of large imagery setting the stage for a website.</small></p>
<p>Websites with bigger, bolder images are becoming more common and the best ones still pay attention to that hallowed web ground: the ""web safe area"" where content can be seen by most people.</p>
<p>Let's get back to that Call of Duty site. <a href=""http://www.callofduty.com/"" target=""_blank"">Open it up.</a>&nbsp;Notice as you stretch the browser wider and wider the image fills the browser but the login button, logo, and content modules all fall within that 960 pixel wide sweet spot, the current-day, generally accepted web safe area. You get the cinema feel of a large image but you can still access all the important content.</p>
<p>So we can do big images now, but do we need to? The short answer is no. What is the goal of your website? Is it about capturing an experience you want your audience to have, like volunteering overseas? A large, inspiring image could be good for that. But if your site needs to get of lot of detailed information to a viewer as quickly and clearly as possible, maybe you don't want to distract them with a huge picture.</p>
<p>The good news is that designers have more room to work with. Whether that larger space is used for the clear organization of lots of information, or a single, large and inspiring photo, web users are having more in-depth experiences online. If you haven't already, maybe it's time you bought your mom a nice new computer?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2061%1","","","","screen_filling_visual_goodness","website web-design visual-experiences video-games seamless.com imagery call-of-duty","website","",

<p>By this, communications experts typically mean that nonprofits should do more than just ask their supporters for money, and that when they DO ask for money, they should ask for it in a warmer, more personal way.</p>","<p>It's a maxim that nonprofit professionals have heard more and more in recent years: ""Thou shalt not treat your supporters like ATMs.""</p>
<p>By this, communications experts typically mean that nonprofits should do more than just ask their supporters for money, and that when they DO ask for money, they should ask for it in a warmer, more personal way.</p>
<p>Sounds reasonable, right? But here's what makes the maxim even more urgent: <strong>Recent studies indicate that nonprofit supporters who take an advocacy action are <a href=""https://www.blackbaud.com/bb/advocacy/Advocates-Donors.aspx"" target=""_blank"">seven more times likely to giv</a></strong><a href=""https://www.blackbaud.com/bb/advocacy/Advocates-Donors.aspx"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">e</span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For the lucky nonprofits that have a robust advocacy network in place then, it's a no-brainer that they engage their supporters with actions on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>But what about nonprofits who don't have the staff or time to run a comprehensive advocacy program? (And what about organizations who don't have a legislative agenda?) </strong></p>
<p>Worry not. With a little creativity, some elbow grease, and the (relatively low-cost) magic of online tools, you can use even the simplest and most low-tech actions to strengthen your supporters' engagement with your organization.</p>
<p>Here is a range of possible online actions you might use to engage your supporters:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help them reach out to decision makers.</strong> Even if you don't have a staff person on the hill, you can use simple tools like <a href=""http://signon.org/"" target=""_blank"">SignOn</a>, <a href=""http://www.thepetitionsite.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Petition Site</a>, and Causes to allow your supporters to write their legislators. Is legislative advocacy not an option for you? Consider letter writing campaigns to CEOs or other corporate decision makers, or letter-to-the-editor campaigns to local newspapers. (Check out <a href=""http://www.idealware.org/articles/few-good-tools-eadvocacy"" target=""_blank"">this great roundup of e-advocacy tools</a> from Idealware for some more good ideas.)</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""2""><strong>Give them opportunities to learn and spread knowledge.</strong> Don't have a legislative agenda? Don't worry. You have a mission, and helping people learn about your issue and why it matters is also a worthwhile action. Encourage people to test their knowledge or learn something new by launching a quiz or poll with simple tools like <a href=""http://www.surveygizmo.com/"" target=""_blank"">Survey Gizmo</a> or <a href=""http://www.surveymonkey.com/"" target=""_blank"">Survey Monkey</a>. Sound too involved? Consider asking your community to share important reports, news stories or photos related to your issue through Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or even just a simple email forward.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""3""><strong>Ask them to offer their two cents.</strong> As a nonprofit, you make decisions every day--why not bring your community in on them with periodic voting or polls? Possibilities range from asking them to choose the art you'll feature in a publication (my favorite example is Easter Seals' vote on the next year's <a href=""http://www.easterseals.com/site/PageNavigator/ntl_2011_Childrens_Calendar_Vote?printer_friendly=1"" target=""_blank"">children's art calendar</a>), to asking them what issues they most want to see your nonprofit tackle in the upcoming year (Working America's <a href=""http://www.workingamerica.org/vote/"" target=""_blank"">priorities vote</a> is a good example). Either way, you'll be giving your community a voice in your story.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""4""><strong>Encourage them to use their own creativity.</strong> While simple, easy-to-complete actions will probably get the most people engaged, you might also offer the occasional action that asks supporters to share a bit more. Consider a photo contest like Ocean Conservancy's <a href=""http://www.oceanconservancy.org/photo-contest/photo-contest-winners.html"" target=""_blank"">Marine Wildlife and Seascape contest</a>, or story-sharing campaigns like <a href=""http://www.nten.org/blog/2011/11/08/whats-your-nten-story"" target=""_blank"">NTEN's recent member appreciation month</a>. You'll not only give supporters an opportunity to use their own creativity, you'll also gather some great images and stories to share with the rest of your community.</li>
</ol>

Komen for the Cure</a> announced that it will no longer fund $700,000 annually to <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/"" target=""_blank"">Planned Parenthood</a>.</p>","<p>Earlier this week, <a href=""http://ww5.komen.org/"" target=""_blank"">Susan G. Komen for the Cure</a> announced that it will no longer fund $700,000 annually to <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/"" target=""_blank"">Planned Parenthood</a>. This funding gap translates into 170,000 mammograms for low-income women- nothing to sneeze at- <a href=""https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=3814&amp;3814.donation=form1&amp;s_src=BreastHealthFund_0212_c3_c3web%20"" target=""_blank"">so donors stepped up to fill the void</a> (Thank you, <a href=""http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/bloomberg-to-give-250000-to-planned-parenthood/"" target=""_blank"">Mayor Bloomberg</a>, for your $250,000 matching gift!), and other organizations released statements &nbsp;<a href=""http://womensmediacenter.com/blog/2012/02/exclusive-komen-vs-planned-parenthood%E2%80%94whats-going-on/"" target=""_blank"">sharing their points of view</a>. As Kivi Leroux Miller, aptly <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-accidental-rebranding-of-komen-for-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">puts it in her blog</a> on the topic, ""<a href=""http://www.komen.org/"">Komen for the Cure</a>, it seems, is no longer a breast cancer charity, but a pro-life breast cancer charity."" <a href=""http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/komen-founder-republican-donor"" target=""_blank"">According to Mother Jones</a>, Kivi might be right.</p>
<p>This decision became a massive multi-media story overnight, and everyone's fingers are in this messy communications pie. While <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4oOh6JhayA&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">Nancy Brinker's video</a> makes the case for their decision, she fails to address the political undercurrent that many people feel is implicit in this decision. By not tackling head-on the issue on most people's minds, she's missing the point of the protests and arguably making matters worse for her organization.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most innovative form of protesting I've seen this week is happening on Pinterest, the new social media darling of the nonprofit sector. <a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/"" target=""_blank"">Beth Kanter</a> started a ""<a href=""http://pinterest.com/kanter/komen-can-kiss-my-mammagram/"" target=""_blank"">Komen Can Kiss My Mammogram</a>"" group board, an aggregate of images related to this protest with comments by the 650+ contributors adding to it daily. &nbsp;It's grassroots activism in pictures; Beth calls it ""PinActivism"". Good stuff.</p>
<p>From a positioning point of view, I'm interested to see how this debacle will impact perceptions of the pink ribbon as the icon for the breast cancer movement? Komen has played a key role in making the pink ribbon (originally created <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/13/us/evelyn-lauder-obit/index.html"" target=""_blank"">by Evelyn Lauder</a>) popular. If the ribbon can transcend politics it should weather the storm. If not, many organizations in the breast cancer movement may have some work to do.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1407%1,1066%2","","","","pink_ribbons_pro_choice_and_pinterest","Positioning Brandraising Pinterest pink-ribbon Komen crisis-management Beth-Kanter","Positioning Brandraising","",

<p>It's a silly meme, but it's also a good reminder for nonprofit marketers to think about the language that your audience speaks. These videos get laughs and shares because they tap into a common language and shared experience--anyone who lives in Brooklyn knows what it's like to argue with a reluctant cab driver who's not keen on crossing the bridge.</p>
<p>So where can your nonprofit find opportunities to tailor your communications to your audiences' experiences and vocabulary? Perhaps you've created a list segment for the college students in your audience--try sending an email with a subject line that's tailored to reflect what's on their mind at this point in the school year. Or maybe you can adapt your next advocacy campaign to use a slightly different message or theme in each of the major cities that you're targeting. Put yourself in their shoes and think about what appeals to them, and you'll have relevant, share-worthy content in no time.</p>

A couple months ago, I had the opportunity to deliver a high-five to Maddy. I was actually more of a recipient of it. It was loud. And it hurt. Really hurt. But I appreciated it, because it was done with such fervor and authority, that one can't help but feel that whatever the reason for the high-five, I <em>deserved</em> it.</p>
<p>I was apparently late to the party, having been told that Maddy is famous for her high-fives. But I've appreciated them so much, that I've gotten my wife to adopt the ""Milan Maneuver."" But I think more people should embrace this. Why should nonprofiteers care about their high-fives? Because everyone needs to celebrate their victories, however large or small. Made your year end fundraising goals? High-five. Launched a new website? High-five. Rescued the last chocolate donut from the coffee place? HIGH-friggin-FIVE.</p>
<p>To make sure that everyone is doing the high-five correctly, I'd drafted Maddy and <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/staff/dan_gunderman"" target=""_blank"">Dan</a> to help demonstrate the signature Madeleine Milan&nbsp;high-five.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Acknowledge a victory. Preferably with a compatriot.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive01.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Demand a high-five. As in, ""high-five!""</p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);""><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive02.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>&nbsp;Line up the hand and arm, so that they're almost vertical.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive03.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /><br /></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>&nbsp;<span>The wind-up. Pull back a little, and begin your forward momentum. Put a lot of weight into it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);""><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive04.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /><br /></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>&nbsp;Connect.&nbsp;Do not slow down.&nbsp;Make sure you meet palms with your partner. Get as&nbsp;much surface area as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive05.gif"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /><br /></span></p>
<p>The test that you've done this correctly is if the decibel level goes way up (it should sound like a whack) and that your palms should be red with hurt.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;""><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/9ffa3cb69416e62bf901d2b1e8aca0a2/files/highfive06.jpg"" width=""534"" height=""322"" /><br /></span></p>

In these conversations&nbsp;we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The evolving definition of social media and popular channels</li>
<li>Thinking about social media as part of a broader communications strategy</li>
<li>Understanding who should staff it and how much time it takes</li>
<li>Elements of social media guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>We end each session with a review of how some nonprofit leaders are using social media. Inevitably, questions about the <a href=""/blog/10-tips-manage-your-professional-and-personal-brand-social-media"" target=""_blank"">blurring lines of personal and professional brands</a>&nbsp;quickly rise to the top. To help leaders better understand how they might navigate questions of time and content, I asked one executive director how she does it. What follows are excerpts from a conversation I had with Rinku Sen, executive director of the <a href=""http://www.arc.org/"" target=""_blank"">Applied Research Center</a>&nbsp;(ARC), a racial justice think tank and home for media and activism:</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">How much time do you spend on social media?</h3>
<p>I spend approximately one hour every day. I usually check my pages and profiles some time before 9:30am, after 8:30pm, and at least two other times throughout the day. This time includes publishing updates, sharing content and ideas, and responding to comments. While I scan what's happening on the primary pages and profiles for ARC, someone else manages those accounts directly. This time is dedicated to my use of Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rinkusen"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/rinku-sen_fb.jpg"" style=""width: 507px; height: 303px;"" /></a></p>
<h3 class=""alt"">How is your use of Facebook and Twitter the same and how does it differ?</h3>
<p>I use Twitter more professionally and politically. I tried tweeting personal thoughts, but they didn't get much response. On Facebook, I post updates that range the gamut--from articles in our <a href=""http://colorlines.com/"" target=""_blank"">Colorlines publication</a> and news about our trainings to videos I find poignant and even when I've had a great meal. It can sometimes surprise me which posts get more of a reaction (likes, comments, shares), so I like to experiment. I actually reached the limit of having 5,000 friends, so I started a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php%20"" target=""_blank"">page as a public figure</a>&nbsp;and have been working to move my contacts and conversation there.</p>

<script src=""http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
<div>I probably post more often on Twitter. Twitter is great for moment-by-moment conversations (like live-tweeting the Oscars), but that frequency can turn people off in Facebook. When I first got started I had my Facebook and Twitter accounts linked, so anytime I posted on one channel it would automatically appear on the other. I soon learned that was annoying to my followers. The language of Twitter (e.g. saying RT or mentioning someone with an @ or putting a # in front of a word) doesn't translate to Facebook and the length or way you tag on Facebook doesn't work well within the confines of Twitter.</div>
<h3 class=""alt"">Your Twitter handle (@RinkuWrites) includes the name of your organization. What was behind your thinking to connect your personal brand to your organization's brand so closely?</h3>
<div>
<p>I have worked at the Applied Research Center for over 10 years. There is little I say or do publicly that is not already connected to ARC. I'm careful about what I share online, just as I am with conversations I have in-person. I've thought about changing my handle to just @RinkuSen because it is that much shorter and easier to remember, and I might do that. Even so, I'd still focus my tweets around our work to popularize racial justice and note my role as ARC's executive director in my bio.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">What about LinkedIn and other channels?</h3>
<p>I know that LinkedIn is important for professional networking, but I don't really get a lot out of it. I have my assistant check it periodically for requests and such, and I look at it once or twice a year, but that's it. I also <a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/author/rinku-sen/%20"" target=""_blank"">blog several times/month</a>&nbsp;and learn a lot by seeing which pieces trigger the most conversation.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Do you have any advice for other nonprofit CEOs who are questioning the need or value to spend their own time in social media?</h3>
<p>I see social media as part of my job representing the organization and being a thought leader. I don't see how any executive director of a relatively public nonprofit could avoid it. In the future, I can imagine board of directors' evaluating their executive director's use of social media as part of their annual review.</p>
<p>If you are nervous, start with one channel and build your confidence and community. It took me about nine months of writing tweets and status updates until I really felt like I got the hang of it. Along the way, I've gotten better by asking my staff for feedback and seeing which tweets or updates get the most responses.</p>

<p>Key messages are curious nuts to crack. They're a bit conceptual and require a serious step out of the trenches to see the bigger story of your nonprofit. Plus, confusion often abounds about what key messages are and how you might use them.</p>
<p>Here’s a definition that we Ducks use from time to time:</p>
<p><strong>Key Messages:</strong></p>
<p>If you had to drill down your story to its most essential, indispensible elements—what would they be? The purpose of developing key messages is to identify the elements that any description of your organization must include, to use these elements to build a structure for your story, and to offer sample language for telling that story.</p>
<p>For us,&nbsp;<em>structure</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is probably the most important word in that description. We think of key messages more as an organizing effort than a writing project. That’s because you’re really trying to&nbsp;<em>outline</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your organization’s story, not&nbsp;<em>write</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it.</p>
<p>Fight Colorectal Cancer is a Big Duck client we worked with to develop key messages as part of a&nbsp;larger brandraising effort. Together, we decided that, for Fight Colorectal Cancer’s audiences to understand the organization, people needed to know three simple things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem: What is colorectal cancer?</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer is cancer that forms in the rectum or colon.</li>
<li><strong>Solution: What does Fight Colorectal Cancer do?</strong>&nbsp;Fight Colorectal Cancer demands a cure for colorectal cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Action: What can you do?</strong>&nbsp;You can join the fight against colorectal cancer.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we continued to develop their key messages, we added supporting and back-up points to fill in the big gaps that remain between those three statements. The details about their nonprofit were put in the appropriate section.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>problem</em>&nbsp;section includes facts and figures, risk factors, common symptoms, a note about the importance of screenings.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>solution</em>&nbsp;section talks about Fight Colorectal Cancer’s patient and family support services, their aggressive approach to improving research, their role as a resource for the entire cancer community, and their advocacy work in DC.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>action</em><span>&nbsp;</span>section offers some basic ideas that anyone can follow (learn more, share information, advocate, donate), and gave clear actions that&nbsp; specific audience members could take (after all, what medical professionals might do is different than what policymakers might do).</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that the prose itself is less important. It’s getting down those big ideas that will serve you best in the long run.</p>
<p>The problem/solution/action statements developed for Fight Colorectal Cancer clarify what they’re all about and how they can engage their audiences in the broadest terms. Once the content is clearly outlined, we started developing specific language that they could also use verbatim, like boilerplate copy and an elevator pitch.</p>
<p>But ultimately, your key messages are meant to be quite flexible. They might serve as the basis for a speech your executive director makes at the gala dinner, or the sections of your overview brochure. So although you can set your tone with the language, don’t get too hung up on specific wording. You’ll tailor that for your specific audiences when it comes time to use your key messages.</p>
<p>So how&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;you use the key messages, once they’re developed? Well, for the answer to that one, you’ll have to head over to the next post&nbsp;… or check out&nbsp;<a href=""http://bigduck.www61.a2hosting.com/resources/book"" target=""_blank""><em>Brandraising</em></a>, by Sarah Durham.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1067%1,1416%2,1409%3","","","","","Duck-pond writing key-messages copywriting","Duck-pond writing key-messages copywriting","",

The promised land for nonprofits. Every day, there's a new success story about someone using Pinterest to get major legislation passed, or raising a million dollars through Foursquare. Ok, not really (yet). But when you're short on resources, time, staff and money (which, let's be honest, is not uncommon when you're working to change the world), how on earth do you even begin to engage, or take your presence to the next level, on these platforms?<br /><br />Well, Melanie Mathos and Chad Norman have put together a step-by-step guide called <a href=""http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118106245,descCd-buy.html"" target=""_blank"">101 Social Media Tactics for Nonprofits</a>. With new guides, resources and how-to manuals popping up every day in this crowded field, it's difficult to stand out.. But I think this book does - and here's why.<br /><br />Starting with basics that can seem overwhelming to those just dipping their toes in the water (e.g. #1 - Claim your Facebook username) and moving on up to the more complicated for those with a bit of experience under their belt (#43 - Livestream your events), this book takes a comprehensive look - not just at the tools and tactics, but at the strategy behind using them. Your organization can have 18 Facebook fan pages, but without a strategy to engage your supporters, you're not exactly going to get very far. And to break it down even further, each tactic is divided into What You Need, How To Do It, and A Closer Look.<br /><br />Peppered in between the tactics, Norman and Mathos include detailed case studies that show how other organizations found success. For example, in #44 - Provide Instant Access to Content with QR Codes - they highlight the <a href=""http://www.pancan.org/"" target=""_blank"">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a>, an organization that <a href=""http://www.netwitsthinktank.com/mobile/scanning-for-good-how-one-nonprofit-used-qr-codes-to-raise-awareness.htm"" target=""_blank"">experimented with QR codes during an awareness campaign at an LA Kings game</a>. I won't give away any campaign spoilers, but reading about concrete examples, both successes and failures, helps you wrap your head around the intricacies of many of these tools.<br /><br />Whether your organization has a staff of four and no communications team, or several people dedicated exclusively to social media, there are relevant tips and tactics for you in this book. One of the biggest selling points to me was the focus on strategy, and their strong recommendation to get that leg work done internally before diving into any of these tactics - and no, I'm not just saying that as a Strategist. Okay, maybe a little.<br /><br />As wary as I am of social media-related books with an inevitable shelf life of mere weeks, I would recommend this one to both those just getting started, and those looking to brush up on their strategic know-how before sending another tweet.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.101socialmediatactics.com/"" target=""_blank"">Click here to find out more about 101 Social Media Tactics. </a><br /><br /><em>What are some of your favorite social media tactics?</em></p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1412%1,2059%2","","","","book_review_101_social_media_tactics_for_nonprofits","Social-Media-tactics social-media facebook strategy communications book-review nptech Experiential-communications Online","social-media","",

The campaign, run by Invisible Children, aims to make a Ugandan warlord named Joseph Kony famous enough to ensure his capture and arrest for crimes against humanity.<br /><br />It took off like wildfire across Facebook and Twitter, and has amassed almost as many critics as views. I could fill up several other blog posts writing about the controversies this video has ignited. Is it the future of nonprofit campaigning? Or just a textbook case of slacktivism? Regardless of how the video makes you feel, there are a few lessons to be learned that can be applied to any nonprofit campaign. Here's what I've learned.</p>
<p><br /><strong>1. Content really is king.</strong> With millions of videos posted to YouTube every day, most barely register a blip on anyone's radar (unless there's a cat involved). The Kony video is a remarkable 30 minutes long, which breaks every rule in the do-gooder video handbook. When's the last time you watched a video online that was more than a minute or two? I'll admit, I didn't think I'd make it past the first few minutes, but I was drawn in immediately. It's slick, well-produced, and compelling enough to hold the attention of an astonishing 50 million people (and counting). Filmmaking is their strength, and it shows, but that shouldn't discourage you from dipping your toes into the world of video - learn from what this video does well, and start small.<br /><br /><strong>2. Position yourself and own it.</strong> In an interview with the New York Times, the co-founder of Invisible Children, Jason Russell, said, ""We view ourself as the Pixar of human rights stories."" That speaks volumes about the kind of communication they're producing - and shows them going against the all-too-common trend of nonprofits holding themselves to different standards than for-profits. Why not strive be the Apple of cancer research? Or the Google of immigration reform? There's a lot our sector can learn from studying some of the world's most innovative and successful companies and applying their best practices to our work.<br /><br /><strong>3. Show the How.</strong> Is there anything more daunting than being told about a huge problem (say, world hunger, or a natural disaster) and not knowing the first thing you can do to make a difference? This is where many nonprofit campaigns fail to make a splash. The Stop Kony video has a very clear theory of change (regardless of how tenuous its connection to reality might be). It states the problem (Joseph Kony is dangerous and needs to be captured), shows what progress has been made (the US has already sent troops to help the Ugandan army), creates urgency (those troops might soon be recalled or lose funding), and tells me exactly what I can do to make an impact (tweet or purchase an action kit to keep the spotlight on Kony). After watching, I felt as though I could immediately do my part in creating change. A problem that might feel overwhelming is suddenly very easy to understand. I'm not saying their theory is the soundest, but it's certainly one of the best examples of igniting action I've encountered in any nonprofit communication.<br /><br />Want to read more about it? <a href=""http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things"" target=""_blank"">This blog post on ForeignPolicy.com</a> is one of the best breakdowns I've read so far, and the New York Times has posted two articles about the campaign, which you can read <a href=""http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/how-the-kony-video-went-viral/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/world/africa/online-joseph-kony-and-a-ugandan-conflict-soar-to-topic-no-1.html?hp"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.<br /><br />What do you think about the Stop Kony campaign?

<p>For the last four years, I have been leading communications for <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a>, which includes working with our friends at Big Duck on each year-end appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the height of summer, when the first sunburn is fading and the second one is setting in...Big Duck reminds us that it's time to start thinking about the end of the year. Every year we're caught off guard and can't believe we have to focus on the holidays. But you know what? They're right.</p>
<p>With proper planning, the combination of a fresh approach and reliable tools, and the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities that may pop up, you can maximize the effect of your year-end appeal with a fully integrated approach using all of your organization's outlets.</p>
<p>First, a little about Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy: We are a nonprofit organization that is focused on ending Duchenne muscular dystrophy - a lethal genetic disorder that affects boys.&nbsp; We are an international organization located in New Jersey, with a staff of about 12. The communication team is me and an amazing part-timer. So please know all of my advice comes out of my experience with little budget and a tiny team, for a niche disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are nine ideas we incorporate into our annual year-end appeal:</p>
<p><strong>1. Listen to your community.</strong></p>
<p>When deciding on what your year-end appeal will be about, make sure that you are listening to what your community is saying.</p>
<p>We have a very active online community on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/parentprojectmd"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, and through our own <a href=""http://community.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Community Site</a>. By staying on top of what people are saying on our Wall or in discussion groups on our site, we know what is important to them - in this case, what research is a priority that they would like to see us invest in and move along.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, this isn't to say that you should allow your appeal to be swayed solely by popular opinion, especially when dealing with research investments that may or may not be the best option for your community or the patients in your community. But it is important to listen to what your constituents want because then they'll give you what you want!</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep the concept simple, clean, strong.</strong></p>
<p>This is a lesson learned from Big Duck that has been invaluable. Our most successful campaigns have been ones where the design and the copy were simple, strong, and exact. We have all learned that the more we talk, the more we write, the less people pay attention (in fact, maybe you've already given up on this blog or are about to...but don't! There are so many exciting anecdotes coming!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we have come up with this concept with Big Duck, we then figure out ways to translate it to our different outlets: mail, email series, Facebook/Twitter, and our Community Site.&nbsp; We tweak the art and copy to make it specific to the outlet.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make the action simple and clean.</strong></p>
<p>What are you asking your community to do? This is a question we deal with everyday, whether or not we are in holiday appeal mode. People today don't have time. They just don't. So asking your constituents to sign this, record that, upload something, forward something else, and give $100 is a recipe for failure for us.</p>
<p>We are most successful when we are straightforward about what we are asking.&nbsp; For example, give us money. That may seem blunt, and it's not fun to ask, but people today appreciate honesty. Just make sure you tell them why they need to give you money and what you are going to do with the money they give you. This goes back to keeping the concept simple &amp; clean and developing a concept based on what your community wants.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make the action shareable. Let the community do some of the work.</strong></p>
<p>When you post on Facebook, or tweet, or send out your email blast, don't just think about the person receiving the message. Think about the person that that person may know, and then make it easy for them to pass the message/ask along.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, we work with a rare, fatal disorder. Our community wants a treatment that will give their sons a long, healthy life.</p>
<p>This past year's concept was ""A Future Without Duchenne - Let's Make It Happen.""&nbsp; For our shareable action, we asked parents to personalize our message when sharing it with friends and family. ""I want Jonathan to be a leading zoologist one day. I believe in a future without Duchenne. Won't you help us make it happen?"" This personalized ""the ask"" for the receiver and it gave the sender a way to call their friends into action.</p>

<p><strong>How does your fee structure work?</strong> Most seasoned freelancers, consultants or agencies have fixed hourly rates that are reflective of the market. Those that charge a flat fee typically track time in detail, using the data from past projects to estimate future work. Asking them to explain how their fee structure works, how they track time, and where overages can occur will help you understand how they get paid and learn how transparent they are.</p>
<p><strong>Who will I work with if I engage you? </strong>Will you be working with experienced people? Many nonprofits have ended relationships with agencies, particularly those offering their services pro bono, because they felt the staff servicing them where too junior or just didn't get it. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How much experience do you have on projects like mine?</strong> If you needed to have open-heart surgery you'd want a surgeon with lots of experience conducting the exact same procedure, right? Ask to see case studies or talk with past clients so you can be sure your investment has a better shot of yielding the expected results. Sure, you may opt to take a chance with a less experienced consultant, especially if the work is being done pro bono or at a discounted fee, but best to know that up front.</p>
<p>A good agency, consultant or freelancer should be as invested as you are in making sure there's a good fit between your needs and what they do. Give them time to ask you questions by phone or face-to-face. Chances are, they can determine if there's likely to be&nbsp; a good fit even faster than you can, as they've (hopefully) 'dated' much more than you have.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","help_hiring_an_agency","staff-capacity proposal hiring consultant agency","","",

<p>If you missed Part 1 of this blog post, you might want to <a href=""http://blog/how_to_run_a_successful_year_end_integrated_appeal_part_1"">read my first four tips</a>&nbsp;before diving in to the final five.</p>
<p><strong>5. Tap into as many outlets and interests at once (webinar, newsletter, person of the month, letter from that person).</strong></p>
<p>I am particularly proud of this past year's campaign because it was truly integrated. Not only did we ask for donations across all of our various outlets, we also included related information in our newsletter, our person of the month series, and in one of the campaign emails.</p>
<p>This year's appeal had to do with funding a specific research project led by a top researcher in our field. So we wrote about the research project in our December newsletter, featured our researcher as our person of the month, and hosted a webinar where this same scientist was able to answer questions and share his findings in a more intimate, accessible way.</p>
<p>We also had one of the emails of the campaign come directly from him. This way he could address what the money was going to be used for and thank the community for their help.</p>
<p><strong>6. Stack the appeal time with victories and ""gifts"" to the community </strong></p>
<p>We try desperately not to make December all about asking. We also try to give back to our constituents. This means events like the above-mentioned webinar (our community loves this kind of access to researchers, lobbyists, therapists, etc.).</p>
<p>We also made sure we had some press announcements ready to come out during the appeal. This way we could reemphasize what we are doing with their investment in us and why of all the Duchenne organizations out there, we are the ones to support. (Yes, even the smallest of diseases have ""competition"" from other foundations!)</p>
<p><strong>7. Be nimble. Be ready to rework your strategy at a moment's notice.</strong></p>
<p>We have been blessed the last few years to receive last minute matches that really inspire people to give. Sometimes we go into a campaign with a matching gift in place, but inevitably we get a donor saying they want to increase the existing match. This is great, of course! But it also means we have to be ready to reword already written emails, status messages, and tweets so that we can get people excited about this surprise gift.</p>
<p>One year, in fact, the project of our campaign changed, about a week before launch. Something critical that desperately needed funding had popped up and it took priority over the plan we had in place. Hopefully this won't happen, but you need to be okay with letting it happen if it means a more successful campaign for a better end result.</p>
<p><strong>8. Give your year-end results quickly.</strong></p>
<p>Our families want to know that their gift made a difference, so we always try to give at least broad results right after the New Year.&nbsp; We also let them know what their gift is being invested in and keep track of that investment throughout the year.</p>
<p>The project we featured in this last campaign will be receiving a grant from us that met the goal we wanted to raise. This research is heading towards clinical trial, and there is already media buzz about it. This kind of news lets our donors know that when we get their gift, we do what we say we're going to do with it, and that their investment gets results.</p>
<p>We can then comment back throughout the year that, because of their gift at the holidays, this project continues to go forward. That keeps the year-end appeal alive in the community until you start the next campaign. And, hopefully, they believe in the projects you continually choose to support with each campaign.</p>
<p><strong>9. Thank, thank, thank!</strong></p>
<p>I know, duh. But it's worth reminding that the way you thank can be almost as important as the way you ask. It can be a simple thank you from the figurehead of your organization that has a personal feel to it, or you can do a little more. Our last campaign had a thank you video from boys in the community with Duchenne. It was embedded in their email receipt, and then we shared it on Facebook when the campaign was over. The response was great.</p>
<p>Just make sure you take the time to think about how you are going to thank your donors. It may make them even more generous next time!</p>
<p>I hope these tips are helpful and that you see how easy and necessary it is to take a campaign concept and integrate it across all of your organization's channels. It just makes the return that much more significant!</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1405%2","","","","how_to_run_a_successful_year_end_integrated_appeal_part_2","Fundraising Campaigns year-end-appeal ppmd Parent-Project-Muscular-Dystrophy","Fundraising Campaigns","",

<p>I recently had the opportunity to sit in on a webinar, <a href=""http://nonprofitwebinars.com/past_webinars/the-social-media-audit/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Social Media Audit</em></a>, presented by Debra Askanase of <a href=""http://www.communityorganizer20.com/"" target=""_blank"">Community Organizer 2.0</a>&nbsp;and Ash Shepherd of <a href=""http://www.npowernw.org/"" target=""_blank"">NPower Northwest</a>. The biggest takeaway for me was that any organization that wants to be strategic in their communications should be incorporating a social media audit into their calendars.</p>
<p>What is a social media audit, you may ask? It's a bird; it's a plane; it's Superman! Well, not really. But it is a tool that to will help you to evaluate your use of social media. It determines what's working well, what's not, and what might work better with some adjustments.</p>
<p>This is the nonprofit world. We all know that resources are stretched thin. So a social media audit can help you better allocate your limited resources. By providing a snapshot of where your organization currently stands and by highlighting areas in which you can strengthen your performance, the social media audit can help you progress towards more effective social media communications.</p>
<p>Here's how to get started:</p>
<p>First, determine what you want to evaluate. There are four broad categories you should focus on when choosing the specific elements you want to evaluate in your audit.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your social media strategy. </strong>This includes core tasks of communications planning and development such as identifying goals and outcomes, selecting a target audience, and choosing which social media platforms to use.</li>
<li><strong>Its implementation.</strong> This includes practices like offering training to those who will be using social media on behalf of your org or monitoring and evaluating social media activities for accountability and improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Its integration.</strong> This includes core elements of integrating social media communications with other communications channels. For example, have you connected&nbsp;your social media to&nbsp;your website or your print materials?</li>
<li><strong>And, its&nbsp;support. </strong>This includes non-communications-specific practices within an organization that help ensure the communications function is successful. Does management understand and support social media as part your overall communications strategy? Are resources dedicated to supporting social media efforts?</li>
</ol>
<p>With a clear idea of what to evaluate, next you must to decide how you will do it. You need to select a measurement scale, or a rubric you can use to evaluate your success, and a methodology for conducting the audit, i.e. interviews, surveys, focus groups, etc.</p>

Okay, maybe this isn't the hugest news, but we're pretty excited.</p>","<p>It's finally time. Whether you made the switch months ago or have been dig-in-your-heels averse to change, as of today all Facebook pages will be converted to timeline format. Okay, maybe this isn't the hugest news, but we're pretty excited.</p>
<p>Timeline offers a bigger and better canvas for nonprofits to engage their Facebook visitors and tell their story. With a little ingenuity (and, yes, maybe some basic Photoshop know-how) the large cover image can showcase who you are far better than a basic profile square. And customized tabs below let you highlight the info and efforts that are most important for your audience to see.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples of nonprofits we think have tackled their timeline particularly well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InternationalRescueCommittee"" target=""_blank"">International Rescue Committee</a></h4>
<p>Evocative imagery and a powerful line of text work together with the profile icon to create a clear and unified impression of what the organization stands for.</p>
<h4><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1cdcf7d1d5932e48384c86954fc2084b/files/fb_feed_small.png"" width=""540"" height=""303"" /></h4>
<h4><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FeedingAmerica"" target=""_blank"">Feeding America</a></h4>
<p>Combining a heartwarming photo with a stark statistic helps simultaneously demonstrate&nbsp;the need for and the impact of their work.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1cdcf7d1d5932e48384c86954fc2084b/files/fb_live_small.png"" width=""540"" height=""303"" /></p>
<h4><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/livestrong"" target=""_blank"">LiveStrong&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>A bold, slightly gritty graphic instead of a photo clearly displays the organization's personality, and the icons below tie in seamlessly with the brand.</p>
<h4><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1cdcf7d1d5932e48384c86954fc2084b/files/fb_acs_small.png"" width=""540"" height=""303"" /></h4>
<h4><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AmericanCancerSociety"" target=""_blank"">American Cancer Society&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>The balloon image is a smart visual expression of their tagline, ""The official sponsor of birthdays.""</p>
<h4><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/1cdcf7d1d5932e48384c86954fc2084b/files/fb_sdzoo_small.png"" width=""540"" height=""303"" /></h4>
<h4><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoZoo"" target=""_blank"">San Diego Zoo</a></h4>
<p>There's some very clever integration here of the profile photo with the large cover image. If you try something like this, just make sure that your profile photo still makes sense when it shows up by itself in your followers' feeds.</p>

<div>Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of working with Kira Marchense, Online Communications Director at the <a href=""http://www.edf.org"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Defense Fund</a> on a session about website redesign for <a href=""http://www.nten.org/ntc"" target=""_blank"">NTEN's Nonprofit Technology Conference</a>. Together, we created a presentation to help nonprofiteers have:</div>
<ol>
<li>A better understanding of what has changed over the years--and what hasn't--and in what people want from your website and how you can deliver it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>New ideas for keeping your site current and interactive.</li>
<li>Criteria to evaluate how much of a redesign you need, and how much you can handle--is a little refresh enough, do you need a complete redesign, or should you leave things alone?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>On the last point, Kira and I worked with Big Duck's intrepid senior designer, <a href=""/about/team/rebecca_hume"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca Hume</a>, to create a flowchart (<a href=""/website-rethink-flowchart"" target=""_blank"">click image</a>) to assess how you and your website are doing in terms of the four major components: goals and audiences; content and structure; design; and technology. Using this chart can help you answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your website give users what they need in the way that they want it?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Does it serve your mission and current goals?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do you have a content strategy and the resources you need to keep your site up to date?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How have the trends toward interactivity, social media, and responsive design affected your website?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

I often wonder how things would have played out for me (especially during high school) had my mom gotten the go-ahead from Dad to christen me Jennifer.</p>","<p>As a Katherine known to close friends and family as a Katie, I've long struggled with feeling like I've outgrown my nickname but haven't yet grown into my full name. I often wonder how things would have played out for me (especially during high school) had my mom gotten the go-ahead from Dad to christen me Jennifer.</p>
<p>In life, it's tricky to know how to proceed when there's a name that's a better fit with your personality and overall essence than the one your parents gave you. From what I understand, going through with an official name change is an arduous legal procedure. In the world of nonprofit communications, such a feat is daunting, but less so.</p>
<p>Since coming to Big Duck as a Copywriting Intern, I've learned more about the importance of an organization's name and things to consider as you ponder a name change.</p>
<p>A name is one of many factors that affect how external audiences talk about and come to think of your organization. It conjures certain connotations and attributes. In an ideal scenario, those connotations and attributes are consistent with how you think of your organization.</p>
<p>Acronyms, I've learned, present a problem on par with the challenges created by nicknames. Maybe an acronym says nothing about the amazing work your organization does. Perhaps it just sounds kind of <em>blah</em>, like in the case of the<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Liberation_Army"" target=""_blank""> Bavarian Liberation Army</a> or the <a href=""http://latinacademy.org/"" target=""_blank"">Boston Latin Academy</a>. But it's easy to overlook an acronym's shortcomings if it stands for something witty, on-brand, or even profound.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, Big Duck worked with an organization that decided to take the plunge and change their name. The Colorectal Cancer Coalition often used the acronym ""C3,"" which didn't really distinguish them from the many other organizations working today. They had already been using the phrase ""<a href=""http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/"" target=""_blank"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>"" as their URL, and the concise yet punchy combination of words jumped out as a more accurate and compelling description of their work--all the makings of a new name.</p>
<p>If you do change your name, how do you convince other people to get with the program?</p>
<p>Old habits die hard. Even though I prefer to go by Katherine or Kate these days, my mom will never call me anything other than Katie. It's tricky to get people to change what they're used to.</p>
<p>Your supporters and donors--and your staff--have likely grown accustomed to whatever name or acronym your organization is currently using. It will be a challenge to get them to regularly refer to you as something different. Don't get discouraged; be patient yet firm with them, and stay committed to the new name you've chosen.</p>
<p>What does commitment to a new name look like? Kind of like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> in 1993. When he changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol that year, Warner Bros. organized a mass mailing of floppy disks with a custom font to use the so-called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Symbol_Album"" target=""_blank"">Love Symbol</a>"" in print media. A lesson in dedication we can all learn from.

<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up your snail mail.</li>
<li>Rifle through it looking for the good bits (you know: letters from home, unexpected checks, the Williams-Sonoma catalogue*).</li>
<li>Realize sadly that there are no good bits--it's all junk mail.</li>
<li>Pull out your smartphone and open the PaperKarma app.</li>
<li>Take a picture of each piece of junk.</li>
<li>Sit back smugly and wait for their ""semi-automated robot army"" to identify the sender and unsubscribe you from their list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only is it dead simple and super fun (somewhat confusingly, I now look forward to getting junk mail, just so I can unsubscribe from it), it also takes a teeny tiny step toward saving the planet, by (hopefully) reducing the amount of paper that goes straight into the recycling without ever being read.</p>
<p>But PaperKarma also gets me thinking. If services like this take off, and unsubscribing from direct mail becomes as easy as taking a photo, what does it mean for nonprofits' direct mail programs? Is it all the more reason to start testing innovative new approaches to make sure your direct mail stands out? Will ""unsubscription"" rates become a regular part of direct mail testing? Or will it make no difference at all? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

And you've heard over and over that instead of sending one-off emails or mail appeals--you should be organizing your communications into campaigns, which are basically a series of messages that tell a cohesive story.</p>","<p>So you're a nonprofit professional. And you've heard over and over that instead of sending one-off emails or mail appeals--you should be organizing your communications into campaigns, which are basically a series of messages that tell a cohesive story.</p>
<p>So, why are campaigns worth your attention? You've heard lots of reasons... Campaigns present your work as a relatable story. Stories are good, check. Campaigns also give your audience a clear idea of what's most important now. Check for urgency. And yes, because campaigns are made of multiple messages, the repetition makes your story easier for your audience to remember... OK, sounds great!</p>
<p>But how do you get past the blank page and actually start your own campaign?</p>
<p>Here at Big Duck, one way we get started is by asking <strong>""What narrative elements do most successful campaigns have in common?"" </strong>and then making sure we've identified each of those elements clearly for our next campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our case, we've identified five narrative elements we feel most successful campaigns include. It's no exact science, but <strong>asking yourself each of these questions can be a helpful jumping off point as you're planning your next campaign:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the specific PROBLEM</strong> <strong>your campaign exists to solve?</strong> Is there a natural disaster you need to respond to? A crucial bill you can't pass without help? A promising area of research that needs more funding? Clarity about the problem or opportunity your campaign exists to solve will help your readers understand why you're reaching out to them now, and why it's urgent and important that they give you their attention.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the SOLUTION?</strong> In explaining the solution to your problem, try to be as specific as possible. If the problem is that animals in Louisiana have been left homeless by a tornado, the solution isn't donating to relief efforts, the solution is to deliver temporary shelters where those animals can live. That specific vision of temporary shelters will be much more motivating and evocative than just ""relief.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What ACTION can people take to make the solution happen? </strong>Usually you'll be asking them to either donate, take an action, or tell their friends. However, make sure that you show why those actions advance the solution. For example, if your solution is to deliver temporary animal shelters, and you're asking people to donate--tell them that their gift will help you pay for the shelters, the transportation, and staffing that will help homeless animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is your campaign's GOAL?</strong> Typically, your campaign will be asking many of your supporters to take individual actions to collectively support your solution. But how will they know if they've achieved that solution? By setting a goal--for how much you'll raise, how many actions you'll generate--you'll provide a measurable target for success, and celebration!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What the TIMELINE for your campaign?</strong> While this element is not as crucial as the previous four, attaching a timeline to your campaign's goal is an effective way to underscore the urgency of your call to action. The goal of ""Help us raise $20,000 to deliver temporary shelters to Louisiana"" is less urgent than if you put it in context of a timeline: ""Help us raise $20,000 before hurricane seasons starts on August 1.""</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've identified your campaign's problem, solution, action, goal, and timeline--use them as the outline for your campaign plan, and make sure each message reinforces all five elements (or at least the first three).</p>
<p>By establishing a clear narrative structure that underlies all of your campaign communications, you'll help your audience get the most from the story you're inviting them to be a part of.</p>
<p>And how about you? Are there any tips or tricks you use when you're developing the narrative for a new campaign? We'd love to hear your approach too!

One, that I was near the back of the line after showing up an hour early before the show (seriously?). Two, there are still fanboys out there who really need to be introduced to some deodorant. And three, this line I was on was not made up entirely of the aforementioned stereotypical fanboys. There was actually a <em>diverse</em> group of people waiting to see this movie. I'm talking about friends, families, couples, kids, seniors, women--and not all of them seemed socially awkward.</p>
<p>Years ago, this would have been unheard of. Most of these types of movies were marketed towards a certain demographic (of the testosterone persuasion).&nbsp; But now, times have changed. Audiences have changed. Geekdom has become mainstream. And movie studios have recognized that.</p>
<p>At Big Duck, we always encourage nonprofits to know their audience. The more specific it is, the better targeted your communications will be. ""Everyone"" or the ""general public"" is not a realistic audience.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, The Avengers had a multimillion-dollar marketing budget, a luxury nonprofits don't have. But their marketing efforts went way beyond reaching the ""general public."" Marvel Studios made sure that the Avengers had a wide yet very targeted marketing, covering very specific demographics, like the geeks of <em>Comic Con</em> and the women who watch <em>The View</em>. And they've gained over $200 million for their efforts so far.</p>
<p>But it's worth reexamining your communications strategy on a regular basis, because you never know when your audience has expanded. Be sure you're ready when you've gained a new set of eyes and ears that are just waiting to help you with your mission.</p>

Part of the impetus for writing the book was to give organizations with little or no budgets for branding projects a foundation to work from, in case they wanted to do it on their own.</p>
<p>Well, one brave soul, Julia Smith, Communications Manager at <a href=""http://www.idealist.org/"" target=""_blank"">Idealist</a>, has agreed to share her experience with us. In this interview, she explains how she was able to use the concepts from the book, including the <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/brandraising"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising pyramid</a>, to help take Idealist through a brand refresh.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">What were some of the challenges you were facing at Idealist that you were hoping Brandraising could help with?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>By early 2011, I had transitioned into a full-time communications role after serving in other positions for several years. At the time, our ""style guide""--mainly a glossary of key terms and a list of grammar rules--was in need of updates, so my managers and I agreed that I would tackle that as one of my first projects.</p>
<p>We knew there were bigger fish to fry, though. Idealist is best known as a nonprofit careers website, and while we take that very seriously, the site is just one component of our larger mission and vision. I knew that some members of our team found it easy to talk about the site but much more challenging to talk about our broader goals.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Around that time I learned that NTEN was hosting the Big Duck team for a series of webinars around the launch of Brandraising, and that anyone who attended got a free copy of the book. I liked the Big Duck blog and was curious about the book, so I signed up.&nbsp;<br /><br /> I found the Brandraising pyramid concept very useful and began the way we begin so many things here: I made a Google doc. I included the name of each level of the pyramid and left blank space beneath each. I wrote to my managers,&nbsp;our Executive Director and our Chief of Staff,&nbsp;to explain that while I was continuing to update our grammar and glossary guide, I'd also like to use Brandraising as a framework for a larger communications guide for all staff. The doc piqued their interest and they were game for a meeting. Thus began our Brandraising adventure!&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">How were you able to use the pyramid when implementing the Brandraising process?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The three of us met several times in the weeks that followed to fill in the top third of the pyramid. We didn't change our mission and vision, but this gave us a chance to look at the slight variations in phrasing we had used over the years. We laid out values and objectives all in one place for the first time, and agreed that they were works in progress and we would use them to spark ongoing conversations with the staff, rather than setting them in stone from ""on high.""&nbsp;<br /><br /> Meanwhile, I worked on an inventory of everything we had that fit into the second and third levels. We weren't starting from scratch with the Identity level; in addition to the style guide I mentioned above, we had a guide to our colors and logos that a design firm had created for us the year before. And our team is small enough that I was able to outline our various communications channels myself -&nbsp;everything from ""the impression someone gets when they walk into a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.idealist.org/info/GradFairs"" target=""_blank"">Grad Fair</a>, are greeted by our volunteers, and receive a nametag with our logo"" to the&nbsp;""<em>Good thing passwords don't have feelings!""&nbsp;</em>lost password error message on our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.idealist.org/"" target=""_blank"">site</a>. But I knew that I would eventually use that third level as a starting point when meeting with staff: ""Can we go through the list of channels, and will you help me brainstorm any that appear in your daily work that I might have left out?""&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">How did you prepare your staff for change and include them in the process?</h3>
<p>My managers had originally asked me to finalize the Brandraising guide and distribute it at a weekly staff meeting. Soon, though, I proposed a different sort of rollout, one that would include more stakeholders earlier on in the process. Everyone on staff knew I was working on ""updates to the style guide,"" and I didn't want them to be surprised and put off by a much more robust resource that they were suddenly just expected to absorb and implement, particularly since we hadn't seen our Values and Objectives laid out like this before.&nbsp;<br /><br /> The timeline looked like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>April 2011: I held that series of meetings with senior managers.</li>
<li>May and June 2011: I met with the managers of every team, explained how the project was evolving, and discussed how best to structure meetings with their teams. Meanwhile, I conducted an anonymous&nbsp;staff survey to figure out how we were doing with communications in general. How comfortable were my colleagues when representing our&nbsp;brand over the phone, on a panel, or at the Thanksgiving dinner table? How hard was it for them to adopt our tone in written correspondence, or doing ""elevator pitches"" about different programs or products? I also posed some fun questions inspired by the positioning and personality sections of Brandraising (""if Idealist had a theme song, what would it be?""), which yielded some particularly funny and cheesy responses.</li>
<li>July 2011: I met with each team (starting with the ones who tend to have the most face time with our audiences or produce the most written material) to talk about how ""simple updates to the style guide"" had grown into a much bigger communications inventory and project, to find out which Values and Objectives resonated and where they spotted disconnects, to discuss the survey results, and to ask for their help in compiling the inventory of Channels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">What has been successful and have you seen any internal or external changes or improvements?</h3>
<p>Since last summer, here are a few things that have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Brandraising Google doc and related resources are now part of the standard orientation for every new hire.</li>
<li>We've used the docs to help make some decisions related to the materials we produce for Idealist Network meetings, the Graduate Degree Fairs, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Last summer we also tried working with a traditional PR firm for a few months. I'm convinced that having the Brandraising conversation so fresh in our mind helped us to see that the firm simply wasn't interested in ""speaking our language.""</li>
<li>The results of our internal survey helped me to plan a Communications <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference"" target=""_blank"">unconference</a>&nbsp;session during our winter staff retreat. I'm currently working on a ""one year later"" survey and a refresher training for our upcoming summer retreat.</li>
<li>We had an all-staff conversation at a staff retreat during which we collectively re-wrote our organizational objectives. Now we can tie pretty much any action we take to one of the three objectives, which makes it easier to manage our time but also to tell our story to the outside world. Pretty exciting stuff!</li>

But I still found myself having a great time.That got me thinking about what a smart job Citi Field was doing to appeal to different audiences, who come with different expectations.<br /><br />For the hardcore baseball fans with season passes, of course, there was baseball (well, a little bit of it). Give 'em a poncho and they'll sit through anything, even continuous loops of some decades-old promo video that was playing to entertain the crowd during the rain delay.<br /><br />For foodies, Citi Field has positioned itself as quite the culinary destination in the outer boroughs. There are outposts of several popular New York restaurants, including my personal pick for the best burger (<a href=""http://shakeshack.com/"" target=""_blank"">Shake Shack!</a>), BBQ, tacos and pizza, not to mention your classic ballpark hotdogs and fries (my personal culinary high or low depending on when you asked).</p>

From your traditional foam fingers (we're number... 3?) to sweatshirts and t-shirts, to scandalous lingerie and not so scandalous socks, if you come with some cash to burn and a desire to drape yourself in blue and orange, Citi Field is the place to blow it.</p>
<p>For kids, there's everything. Cotton candy and hot fudge sundaes, Mr. Met roaming around, and a chance to see your heroes up close and personal. Not to mention how cool it is to ride the elevated subway alllllll the way out to the middle of nowhere in Queens.<br /><br />It was incredibly impressive that even I stayed through the rain delay, and was entertained the whole time. Of course, my fellow ducks might have had a little bit to do with that, but Citi Field knew how to keep me engaged, even if it was just easy access to hot dogs, cotton candy, and beer.</p>

Well, here it is. At Big Duck, we talk a lot about knowing your audiences, and figuring out how to tailor your communications to different groups, so your message truly resonates. Citi Field is a stadium where you go to watch baseball. Period. But they've also made sure that even half-hearted fans have a great time when they come to a game. It's important that you're communicating exactly what and who you are, whether it's a baseball stadium or an animal rights group, &nbsp;in a clear, consistent way. But the real magic comes in knowing and understanding your audience well enough to move people to action - whether that action is donating, participating in an advocacy action, or buying tickets for a game later that season.<br /><br /> And Citi Field moved me to action for sure, since on the way home, I actually declared, ""That was fun. We should do it again!"". Even with soaking wet feet (ugh).<br /><br />Go Mets! Oh, they lost that night.

In an office like ours, for example, it takes a lot of paper and coffee cups to keep things going.</p>
<p>Most of us probably want to create less garbage and recycle everything we can. But whether at the office or at home, building habits that reduce waste doesn't come without some real effort. That's why a team of us here at Big Duck have thrown on our proverbial capes and taken on the task of making the office a less wasteful place.</p>
<p>We are the Green Team, and though our job may seem daunting, creating a greener culture in your office can be both easy and fun.</p>
<p>The Green Team decided that in order to encourage proper waste management in the office, we needed a combination of education and engagement. Behold! The Recycling Challenge!</p>
<p>The challenge aimed to see how well the Ducks really knew their recycling dos and don'ts. And it turned out that, when put into teams, they knew the rules better than we'd expected, based on the many, many mistakes we'd seen in the Big Duck bins.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/clockslide.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></p>
<p>The challenge: in 60 seconds, correctly sort used items in the trash bin, the paper and cardboard bin, or the blue bin for glass, plastic, and metal recycling. We awarded one point for each correctly sorted item. And boy did they rack up points! As we watched the Ducks sort through the items in frantic and eager discussion, the Green Team witnessed how a little bit of fun can lead to a lot of engagement.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/yougoglencoco.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></p>
<p>It turns out that when the Ducks share knowledge and recycle as a group, we can do it right.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/shocking.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></p>
<p>Having grabbed their attention, we went through the rest of our presentation. Did you know that every year Americans throw away enough office paper to build a 12-ft. high wall from Seattle to NYC, or that, on average, a coffee drinker throws away 250 cups a year, cups that cannot be recycled? Just these facts inspired Ducks to take mugs to the coffee shop across the street instead of adding to the landfill.</p>
<p>We showed our colleagues how their individual actions fit into the larger picture of recycling, which made them feel like their small behavior changes could actually make a difference.</p>
<p>And that's the story nonprofits need to tell, too. How does spending ten minutes writing to your state senator fit into the larger mission of your organization? How do donors who give $25 fit into the story of your fundraising appeal? (Hint: They're the heroes.) The actions are simple; the difference is huge.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1409%1,18910%2","","","","the_green_team_changing_our_world_one_coffee_cup_at_a_time","Around-the-office storytelling Recycling messaging Green-Team audience","Recycling messaging audience","",

<p>Let's be honest: designing good nonprofit logos can be tricky work.</p>
<p>Sure, they share the same basic principles as for-profit logos. Both should be rooted in a clear understanding of the target audience and a well-articulated brand strategy.<br /><br /> But when your product is justice, or wellbeing, or a better world, it can be more complicated to boil down into a nice, tidy mark than it can be when designing for a soft drink, or an airline, or a shoe. (Especially without resorting to clichés like&nbsp;the dreaded&nbsp;<a href=""http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=8387"" target=""_blank"">Neutered Sprite</a>.)<br /><br />Below are a few tips for confronting common challenges in nonprofit logo design—and examples of organizations that have successfully overcome these difficulties. Clearly, there’s no one solution, and creative decisions should be the result of collaboration with an experienced designer. But seeing and understanding how other organizations have tackled these issues can help shed some light on the process.<br /><strong><br /><a href=""http://worldwildlife.org/"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/fdbd0f9f6d7bdbc3da80848c17fb48eb/files/img01.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""120"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""5"" align=""left"" style=""float: left; margin: 0px 5px;"" /></a>1. A good logo doesn’t have to show everything your organization does.</strong><br />Most nonprofits do more than one thing, and it can be tempting to try to cram it all into the logo. But limiting the scope to a specific, poignant representation of your work is generally far more effective.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.worldwildlife.org/home-full.html"" target=""_blank"">World Wildlife Fund</a>&nbsp;protects hundreds of species around the globe, but by focusing on a single endangered panda, their logo becomes something memorable that people can connect with emotionally.</p>
<p><br /><strong><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/fdbd0f9f6d7bdbc3da80848c17fb48eb/files/img02.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""120"" hspace=""5"" align=""left"" style=""float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" />2. A good logo doesn’t even have to show anything your organization does.&nbsp;</strong><br />Nonprofit work often comes with fallback imagery: columns for museums, ribbons for disease awareness, and did we mention Neutered Sprites? These may be easy ways to show what type of organization you are, but they won’t necessarily set you apart. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://si.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Smithsonian Institution</a>’s abstract sunburst-compass logo manages to capture what they’re all about—discovery, illumination, and inspiration—without showing a single building.</p>
<p><strong><br /><img hspace=""5"" border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/fdbd0f9f6d7bdbc3da80848c17fb48eb/files/img03.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""120"" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"" align=""left"" />3. A good logo doesn’t have to include an illustrated mark.&nbsp;</strong><br />There’s a common misconception that a “real” logo needs a mark—an image element that supplements the organization name. But some of the most effective nonprofit identities are based on a distinctive use of typography, color, or other design elements. Oversized words and phrases that can’t be contained by the page provide a perfectly edgy visual metaphor for&nbsp;<a href=""http://bam.org/"" target=""_blank"">BAM</a>’s boundary-pushing programs and performances.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. A good logo can turn around a disadvantage.</strong><strong><img hspace=""5"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/fdbd0f9f6d7bdbc3da80848c17fb48eb/files/img04.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""120"" style=""float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" /></strong></p>
<p>To be clear, Big Duck almost always recommends against using acronyms, whether speaking, writing, or designing your logo. A string of letters is often confusing, usually forgettable, and simply less meaningful than an actual name. But occasionally these abbreviations are so entrenched that they’re unavoidable and have to be dealt with creatively. In a recent redesign,&nbsp;<a href=""http://iava.org/"" target=""_blank"">Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America</a>&nbsp;(IAVA) transformed their acronym into a stylized logo. Reminiscent of military bars or stencils, this treatment gives fresh energy and significance to four simple letters—whether or not you even see them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><br /><img hspace=""5"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/fdbd0f9f6d7bdbc3da80848c17fb48eb/files/img05.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""120"" style=""float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" />5. A good logo can make people look<br />(and think) twice.</strong><br />While visual clichés are generally something to avoid, occasionally they can be turned into something really smart. The logo for mediation services organization&nbsp;<a href=""http://nypeace.org/"" target=""_blank"">New York Peace Institute</a>&nbsp;puts a new twist on a recognized symbol for conversation, with the overlapping area in the speech bubbles becoming a third, neutral voice. By asking people to rethink an established icon, this logo truly surprises and sticks with you.<br /><br />Have you dealt with other nonprofit identity design hurdles? Or know of a logo you think is particularly smart?

<p><small>People like Nadine Dillon, the Program Officer, Communications at New Visions for Public Schools, or Kathryn Glass, the VP of Communications at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, are turning up more and more at conferences like Fundraising Day to learn the basics of fundraising so they can do their communications jobs better. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p>Over a dozen years ago, I decided that my company, Big Duck, should focus our efforts entirely on helping nonprofits communicate better. Within 6 months it also became apparent that if we were going to do that we had to speak the common tongue of nonprofit communications; fundraising.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've become more and more convinced that it takes a solid foundation in fundraising to truly help a nonprofit communicate well- even if you're also doing outreach, membership, client recruitment, or social marketing. After all, the development people need to be on message, consistent, and able to put the organization's best foot forward in order to fundraise. &nbsp;Without that, most of the rest of it ain't gonna happen.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1406%2","","","","marketing_fundraising_great_communications","Fundraising Message marketing consistency AFP","Fundraising Message","",

Lara is an author, speaker, expert on working on purpose, and senior vice president of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.echoinggreen.org/"" target=""_blank"">Echoing Green</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Echoing Green is a nonprofit social venture fund that identifies, invests in, and supports some of the world's best emerging social entrepreneurs. Through our prestigious Fellowship and Work on Purpose programs, we work to unleash next generation talent to solve the world's biggest problems. Needless to say, when considering the redesign of our work space this past January, and how to transform our drab cubicles into an energetic and collaborative environment that better communicated our big brand, we had a lot to consider.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With our consistent growth over the past several years, injection of four new staff positions in just the last year, and preparation for our annual summer interns, our office was long overdue for a redesign for expansion purposes. However, we also saw this as a great opportunity to bring our brand to life. Luckily, we found Taylor &amp; Miller, our architects for the project, and they helped to bridge our brand and space.</p>
<p>Since we did not have the capacity to relocate our office during the renovation, our transformation had to occur while we could work remotely for a short period of time. So in just over a week, we tore down the traditional cubicles that literally and figuratively blocked communication, and implemented the porous boxes we have today. The new design dually serves to promote interaction and provide opportunities for private reflection. Some of the tenets of our brand and how we realized them are explored below.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/tm_cubes_rendering.jpg"" style=""width: 534px; height: 288px;"" /></p>
<h4>Bold</h4>
<p>By working with architects to develop the new space, our design is completely unique from any other office. It pushes the boundaries of workplace aesthetics and leaves an impression on all of our guests, who we are happy to host! For the occasional guest and Fellow that stops by, we created coworking spaces that function as an open-air work hub when they need an impromptu office.</p>
<h4>Nimble</h4>
<p>One of the unique features of having our headquarters in New York means we are subject to space constraints and potential change, just like any growing family in the city. We designed with flexibility in mind, and our stacked boxes are completely portable and able to be rearranged to suit new spaces, if and when the time comes.</p>
<h4>Innovation</h4>
<p>Our core program is built on social innovation, and while the design itself lives and breathes innovation, so too does our staff with new, specifically collaborative areas such as the lunch bar, and a smaller, more intimate conference space. Some of our more collaborative teams had the choice to be housed in their spaces all together for hands-on brainstorming and conversation.</p>
<p>Echoing Green represents bold visionaries who drive social change. Our staff needs to work collaboratively to promote this work, and to continue to be inspired by each other as we grow. While our redesign was of central concern for logistical reasons and space creation, we reap the benefits of the intangibles every day, through easier face-to-face communication, creative stimulation and spontaneous moments of inspiration. The sum is greater than its parts, and our redesign has helped make us a stronger community.</p>

<p>Thinking about how your company can&nbsp;do some good&nbsp;in the world--and&nbsp;boost your bottom line?</p>
<p>Sarah Durham, founder and principal of&nbsp;Big Duck, a communications firm that works with nonprofits, shows you how to get started with&nbsp;cause marketing, i.e., linking your brand to a specific cause so that both sides benefit.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Be authentic</h3>
<p>""The most successful examples of cause marketing are the ones that emerge organically--where the&nbsp;values and agendas&nbsp;are aligned,"" Durham says. (Think Sprint's campaign with DoSomething.org to keep teens from texting while driving.)</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Think small</h3>
<p>For a small biz, a massive nonprofit might not give much in a relationship. ""Honestly, a big organization just wants your money,"" Durham says. ""But you can have a&nbsp;profound impact&nbsp;on a small nonprofit. Why not be their champion?"" Hook up with a local charity or one that operates in your (digital) space.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Grow the love</h3>
<p>You don't need&nbsp;tons of money&nbsp;or spare time to get moving. ""Small, discrete campaigns are often effective,"" Durham says. Start with a micro-campaign surrounding a one-day event or a short-term effort. Then build a deep relationship over time.</p>
<p><strong>Give it up.</strong>&nbsp;How do you want your business to give back?</p>

It's been a lot of fun, I've met some great people, and heard some excellent questions and insights.</p>
<p>But one thing has plagued me: finding examples of nonprofits that write really well for the web.</p>
<p>We've checked out the websites of <a href=""http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=16"" target=""_blank"">Webby winners</a>, big international nonprofits, small start-up organizations, and even ventured into the for-profit world.

<p>So, dear Duck Call readers, a challenge for you... do you know of any nonprofits that write well for the web? If so, share the love and give them a public shout-out in the comments!</p>
<p>We're looking for examples of online writing (you know: websites, emails, that kind of thing) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly speaks to the organization's audiences;</li>
<li>is short, clear, and jargon-free;</li>
<li>feels trustworthy and credible;</li>
<li>and, most importantly, uses headings, bullets, links, negative space, and other tricks to <a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html"" target=""_blank"">make the copy easy for lazy online readers to scan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestions? Your answers will help inspire and inform your hard-working colleagues at nonprofits across the land. Plus, the person who posts the best example might just win a grateful hug from the Duck of their choice...</p>

<p>That is an unaltered message.</p>
<p>But my mom thought the email was so hilarious that she sent it to my sister and me. Honestly, I think it's the only email she's ever forwarded to me.</p>
<p>What this demonstrates better than anything is that even your auto-responder messages are a terrific opportunity to showcase your brand, especially your personality. The CD Baby message tells me very quickly that they're quirky (in that uniquely Portlandian way), fun, caring, and personal.</p>
<p>Yes. Their automatically generated emails are personal. Pretty impressive, right?</p>
<p>It also gave one of their audience members a warm and fuzzy feeling that she'll take with her to her next CD purchase. They managed to genuinely connect with her.</p>

<p>I, for one, have been indulging in an almost freakish obsession with gymnastics (The spirit! The sparkles! The sportsmanship! McKayla Maroney's vault!).</p>
<p>And just last week, when <a href=""/about/team/nickie_rudolf"" target=""_blank"">Nickie</a>--one of two Ducks who were born and raised across the pond--went home to visit family, those of us in Brooklyn were pretty jealous. (Though there weren't really grounds for jealousy. As it turns out, England is more than just London, and Nickie was in Bristol, nowhere near Olympic Park. Oh well.)</p>
<p>But we've also been talking about the London Organizing Committee's protection of the Games' official sponsors and of the Olympic brand itself--an overzealous (to say the least) crackdown on any illegal associations with the Olympics.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights, just in case you haven't yet read about it: An army of purple-hat-wearing brand police can enter nearby businesses and fine them up to $31,000 for unauthorized use of Olympic connections. There's a whole set of rules, and some are rather specific: a list of banned words includes ""summer,"" ""gold,"" and even ""London.""</p>
<p>For a few non-sponsors who are pushing the envelope without breaking the law, the stringent rules have actually given them new ways to flex their creative muscles. Paddy Power's posters take jabs at Olympic brand protection. (After a <a href=""http://Link http"" target=""_blank"">brief legal struggle</a>,&nbsp;Paddy Power emerged victorious.)</p>
<p>Nike just launched its ""Find Your Greatness"" campaign, releasing a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hEzW1WRFTg"" target=""_blank"">TV spot</a>&nbsp;that features all the Londons of the world--all except London, England, and which, you must admit, is pretty clever in how it captures the Olympics' essence without a single mentions of the games themselves.</p>
<p>This just goes to show how provocative following the rules can be.

If you've partnered with an agency or a consultant, you have an array of new materials--perhaps a fresh logo, tagline, or mission statement, or maybe even something as dramatic as a new name. You're ready to communicate to your audience. Now what?</p>","<p>Rebranding your nonprofit, regardless of your organization's size, is a huge project. If you've partnered with an agency or a consultant, you have an array of new materials--perhaps a fresh logo, tagline, or mission statement, or maybe even something as dramatic as a new name. You're ready to communicate to your audience. Now what?</p>
<p>The next step is to create what's commonly known as a <em>brand guide </em>(sometimes called a <em>style guide</em>). It's a document that consolidates all the work you've just done (and more) into a single rulebook. It's your organization's go-to communications reference, a handy resource for your staff. ""How do I use this new logo?"" ""What are our brand colors?"" The answers to these kinds of questions should be easily found in your brand guide. It's a great, centralized way of building institutional memory.</p>
<p>At Big Duck, we create ""brandraising guides,"" a jacked-up version of a brand guide that covers not only your visual identity, but your messaging platform and brand strategy as well. When possible, we like to include templates for e-signatures, Word doc templates, and other elements that everyone on staff should know how to use.</p>
<p>Consistent communications involve more than just design. It's the materials you write, the words you speak, the templates you use, and more. And consistency is key. Being able to talk to your audience the same way, every single time--whether visually or verbally--makes you that much likelier to get your message across, especially when working on a tight budget.</p>
<p>Here are some things to consider when creating your organization's brand guide:</p>
<h3>1. Organize and design your brand guide well.</h3>
<p>Treat the production of your brand guide as you would a major brochure project--leave time to write, design, and review it internally before you consider it done. If there are specific topics unique to your organization, include them. Add a table of contents so people can easily access specific topics, number the pages, and <em>design</em> your guide so it's easy to read and reference. The final result might be a PDF--not a Word document--that you distribute digitally and print out hard copies of for reference (no need to have it professionally printed unless you have a huge staff). Your guide should exemplify the rules of your brand, serving as an example to others of how to use it well.</p>
<h3>2. Assign a brand cop.</h3>
<p>Whether it's your executive director, the head of development, or a communications staffer, there should always be at least one designated brand cop in your organization. Your brand cop is the resident authority on all things brand-related, someone who can answer questions and verify that all of your materials follow the terms outlined in your guide. He or she is also often the keeper of resources (artwork, fonts, logos, etc.). Don't forget to include your brand cop's name and contact information at the beginning of your guide, and make sure whomever you've designated is empowered to enforce the rules. (This role is probably not the best fit for someone who'll be ignored.)</p>
<h3>3. Schedule a training and share, share, share.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Once your brand guide is finalized and ready to share, you'll probably have a very thorough document. Unfortunately, thorough might mean a 30-page behemoth. Who's going to read all of it? Gather relevant staff, volunteers, freelancers, and vendors in a room, make copies of the guide for everyone, and walk them through it. People tend to retain information when they're actually coached through something, and besides, in a room you'll get their undivided attention. If you have a large document, you might also want to break up your trainings based on the sections within your guide. As you hire new staff or work with new consultants and vendors, be sure to send them your brand guide and give them a casual walk-through so that they also use it appropriately and consistently.</p>
<h3>4. Keep it up-to-date.</h3>
<p>Think of your brand guide as a living document. As you live with your brand and work with it over time, you may find that there are rules that you want to add, or things to change. There should be an area on the front cover to place the current month, year, and version number, so you can track the latest version of the document. And as you update your brand guide, make sure everyone in your organization is informed on the changes and knows what the latest version is.</p>

To gear up for our session on ""Mixing Business and Pleasure: Managing Your Personal Brand in Social Media,"" we asked nonprofiteers (readers like you!) to respond to a quick survey about their own behaviors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We heard from 209 nonprofit staff, consultants, and the people who love us--and some of the results suprised us. While not scientific, the survey offers some interesting insights and we highlighted the key findings in our presentation (included in the slides below and <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bigducknyc/mixing-business-and-pleasure-managing-your-personal-brand-in-social-media"" target=""_blank"">online here</a>). Here are some of those insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most are mixing it up. </strong>72% of the 209 respondents describe their approaches to personal/professional use of social media as either 'blended' or 'segmented by channel'; only 22% keep them 'totally separate'.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Even when people 'blend', there is a tendency to use some channels more personally or professionally.</strong> The top three channels people use 'personally' are: Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest; the top three channels people use 'professionally' are Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Most people tend to favor using blogs and LinkedIn 'professionally' and Foursquare, Google+, and Instagram 'personally'.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sharing news of friends, family, or other major life events and news/current affairs dominates Facebook posts.</strong> And work complaints? Well, 44% of repsondents never talk about the ins and outs of their job on Facebook.</li>
<li><strong>More than half (51.2%) of respondents are NOT friends with their supervisor on Facebook,</strong> while approximately 10% limit what their boss can see through account settings.</li>
<li><strong>The majority of respondents review their account settings in Facebook at least twice/year.</strong> About 1 out of 3 respondents (31.6%) check their settings monthly, while 1 out of 5 (17.7%) check it annually, and several people haven't looked at their settings since they frist signed up.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking of privacy, it all depends on the network. </strong>Most keep their tweets open (only 7.7% block their Twitter updates), but only 1 out of 3 (33.5%) like to share their location via Facebook, Foursquare, or other location-based network.</li>
<li><strong>Almost everyone uses LinkedIn, but hardly anyone asks for recommendations with any regularity </strong>(despite the fact that <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/08/02/higher-google-search-results/"" target=""_blank"">your LinkedIn profile is one of the top results for your name in Google</a>). 34.9% are too shy or humble to ask for recommendations and 38.3% rarely ask beause they 'don't want to bother people and/or have to write recommendations in return'.</li>
<li><strong>A significant number admit to Googling themselves pretty regularly. </strong>14.4%&nbsp;looked up the results of their name in Google within the past week, while 30.6% had checked within the past month, and 35.4% had checked at some point in 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond checking, almost half of the respondents monitor their brand </strong>using Klout, SocialMention, or other service.</li>
<li>Finally,<strong> time spent on social media (personally and professionally) is quite high:</strong>
<ul>
<li>8.6% spend more than 40 hours/week;</li>
<li>19.6% spend between 20-40 hours/week;</li>
<li>27.8% spend between 10-20 hours/week;</li>
<li>32.1% spend between 5-10 hours/week; and</li>
<li>12.0% spend less than 5 hours/week.</li>

I spend much of my time working with clients to write simply and clearly.</p>
<p>Often, for reasons beyond our control, the language we use in the nonprofit world is full of jargon. And to our outside audiences, of course, that jargon can be uninspiring (at best) and utterly meaningless (at worst).</p>
<p>I see it as one of my missions in life to get our nonprofit clients to use simple language in how they write. I'll often push them to use a word that's a little less accurate if it's easier to understand.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/sweet-clarity"" target=""_blank"">blog post</a>&nbsp;a couple of years ago, I even told readers that it was okay to sacrifice grammar for the sake of clarity. When people understand what you do, they understand why they should support you. Gosh, I love clarity.</p>
<p>The fine folks at the <a href=""http://www.militaryfamily.org/"" target=""_blank"">National Military Family Association</a>&nbsp;shared with us the article below by Eric Newton at the <a href=""http://www.knightfoundation.org/"" target=""_blank"">Knight Foundation</a>. And it's one of those articles that got me thinking, ""Yes!"" over and over again, as I made my way through it. It's full of useful stuff, and I encourage you to read it from start to finish.</p>
<p>I particularly liked that Newton acknowledges that simplifying your writing does not equal dumbing it down. In my experience, actually, it's quite the opposite. It's much harder to be clear and simple, and it's the best and smartest writers who do it well.</p>
<p>Anyway, nonprofiteers, please read on. And thanks to Eric Newton and the Knight Foundation for the permission to reprint the article on the Duck Call blog and for singing my song so beautifully--and clearly.</p>
<h3>For Foundations, Clearer Writing Means Wiser Grant Making<br />By Eric Newton</h3>
<p>Clarity matters. That seems obvious. Yet in our nation's capital, when the Sunlight Foundation this spring released a study measuring how well lawmakers communicate, we learned even clarity can be controversial.</p>
<p>Sunlight found that members of Congress have made a big leap these past seven years in their ability to talk clearly. You would think all would jump for joy. We want open government: Clear talk is more accessible than jargon. But no. Sunlight's news release--and most of the news-media coverage--took a different tack. They asked: ""Is Congress getting dumber or just more plainspoken?""</p>
<p>That's just wrong, and it brings into focus a big issue for foundations.</p>
<p>Too often, we fall into the trap of believing complex communication equals intelligence. Fancy words mean you're smart; simple words mean you're dumb. Because my foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, was founded by two of America's leading newspapermen, we think about this topic a lot and we believe the opposite is true. You have to be smart to convey difficult subjects in clear, understandable prose. If you can do it, your work will be more effective.</p>
<p>To measure Congress, Sunlight used something called the Flesch score. Rudolf Flesch, author of<em> Why Johnnie Can't Read--and What You Can Do About It</em>, created this measure of readability. The higher your Flesh score, the more understandable you are. The clearer you are, the more people you can reach. Let's test the Flesch score of a classic children's song:</p>
<p><em>Three blind mice<br />Three blind mice<br />See how they run<br />See how they run<br />They all ran after the farmer's wife<br />Who cut off their tails with a carving knife<br />Have you ever see such a sight in your life<br />As three blind mice?</em></p>
<p>Run a spell check in Microsoft Word, and if your settings are right, a Flesch score will pop up. Without line breaks, ""Three Blind Mice"" scores a nifty Flesch 70. No wonder everyone understands it.</p>
<p>Yet if foundations sang ""Three Blind Mice,"" it would go more like this:</p>
<p><em>Three rodents with defective visual perception<br />Three rodents with defective visual perception<br />Visualize how they perambulate<br />Visualize how they perambulate<br />They all perambulated after the agricultural spouse<br />Who severed their appendages with a kitchen utensil<br />Have you ever visualized such a spectacle in your existence<br />As three rodents with defective visual perception?</em></p>
<p>That scores a Flesch 0 (on a scale of 0 to 100). Unlike Coke Zero, Flesch 0 is a bad thing, and 100 is the best possible result. Too often, this is how we in philanthropy talk and write. We litter our points with jargon. Our message becomes ambiguous. Truly, how can we expect to help people if they can't understand us?</p>
<p>At the Knight Foundation, our mission is to advance ""informed and engaged communities."" That just can't happen without clarity. So we use the Flesch score. We try to keep our internal documents at a Flesch 30 or greater, our press releases Flesch 40, and our speeches Flesch 50. Since any readability test is only a rough measure, we don't sweat decimal points. Numbers rounded off are fine.</p>
<p>Knight is certainly not the only foundation that believes you must be part of society to help improve it. Michael Bailin, when president of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, wrote: ""The real threat of unclear language is its power to extinguish thoughtful public discourse.""</p>
<p>Indeed. How can we expect a community to act on a study if it can be understood only by a few Ph.D.'s?</p>
<p>Even worse, noted Tony Proscio, author of <em>Bad Words for Good</em>, is what folks do when they don't understand: ""People who can't puzzle out your real meaning will soon draw their own inferences about it.""&nbsp; (Congratulations to Mr. Bailin for financing Mr. Proscio's work on clear foundation writing.)</p>
<p>After 11 years of grant making, I've learned, sometimes the hard way, that clarity does matter. When our writing is clear, we understand each other. Foundation paperwork moves faster, questions are fewer and smarter, our discussions are richer, and the money we give away achieves more. People know what they are trying to do and why. Clear writing allows all parties to get on the same page and move in the same direction. Think about a grant as a common dream of a better future. Clear writing helps us dream together.</p>
<p>It can be fun. At Knight Foundation, we run seminars like ""Writing Tips and Tricks."" We have a consulting writing coach, Mary Ann Hogan. Just the other day, we gathered at lunchtime to play ""Jargon Jeopardy,"" a version of the game show that rewarded clear thinking. My favorite team name was the ""Serial Commas.""</p>
<p>My favorite game moment was when the word ""stakeholder"" came up. The host (me) joked that the only stakeholder who lived up to the title was Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She not only held stakes but plunged them into the hearts of the undead. I sometimes wish I could do that to the news releases that foundations put out.</p>
<p>Federal agencies have been urged to keep their writing simple. Under the new Plain Writing Act, officials must communicate more clearly with the public. Even the feds now must use the active voice, avoid double negatives, favor personal pronouns, and run the other way if someone says ""incentivizing.""</p>
<p>The nonprofit Center for Plain Language, founded for federal workers, gives awards for the best and worst of government-speak, including a ""turnaround"" prize for the most improved agency. If lawmakers were given awards like that, maybe they would get even better.</p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation knows it overcooked its news release. Flesch tests estimate the minimum grade level that can understand a piece of writing. But they have absolutely nothing to do with the intelligence of the speaker.</p>
<p>The average American communicates at about an 8th-grade level. That does not mean America is in the 8th grade. It only means that we prefer a level of clarity that can be understood by everyone all the way down to the 8th grade. Congress is now talking at a grade level that reaches down to the 10th grade; it used to be the 11th grade. So its members got a little clearer but not ""dumber.""</p>
<p>If you ask me, they are still not clear enough. There's still a lot of ""Three Rodents With Defective Visual Perception"" going on in Washington. (That version of the song, by the way, scores at Grade 28. It's pretty easy to hide what you're really doing if that's the tune you're singing.)</p>
<p>Of course, clarity doesn't equal truth. But it helps. Though Sunlight was wrong to equate simple words with simplemindedness, it still did two good things.</p>
<p>First, it raised the issue. Second, it called attention to an amazing new Web site it created:&nbsp;<a href=""http://capitolwords.org/"" target=""_blank"">capitolwords.org</a>. The site is a gift of the digital age. You can type in a word and see who said it in Congress, when, and why. You can see what words were most used each day, track their usage over time, see which words your member of Congress used most. You can even type in ""clarity"" and see what kind of debate Sunlight created with its study.</p>
<p>The holy book of clear writers is <em>The Elements of Style</em>. Hear its wisdom: ""Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.""</p>
<p>What is the penalty, in foundation work, for writing that does not make every word tell? We waste money that isn't ours to waste.</p>
<p>I remember years ago looking at a report from a longtime grantee. The project was to get young people into a certain career. After a decade, and considerable expense, not one young person who had gone through the program had gotten into that profession. I looked carefully at the reports and at our grant documents. The grantee's work fell within the language of the grant. But the grant never set a clear goal. Talk about ""defective visual perception.""</p>
<p>If I could wave a magic wand: Grantees would help edit foundation paperwork about their projects. Grant write-ups (our internal summaries) would be so clear they could be news releases. Grantee reports would be so honest you could put them right online. Grantees would blog their benchmarks. The foundation would speak not only of what it has done, but candidly about what it's thinking of doing and why.</p>
<p>How do you make these big changes? One word at a time. So, when you next look down at the sentence in that grant write-up that says, ""The primary stakeholder will operationalize the leverage so they can scale their sustainability infrastructure,"" please change it to ""They will hire a fundraiser.""</p>

After all, the biggest benefits of a strong nonprofit brand--creating one clear impression of your organization, increasing recognition and trust, and making communications easier and more efficient--really aren't being met unless you're insistent on being consistent.</p>","<p>Okay, so the word sounds like a snooze, but consistency can actually be your branding BFF. After all, the biggest benefits of a strong nonprofit brand--creating one clear impression of your organization, increasing recognition and trust, and making communications easier and more efficient--really aren't being met unless you're insistent on being consistent.</p>
<p>Here are a few good ways to do it:</p>
<h3>1. Create a brand guide.</h3>
<p>It's tough to be consistent without documentation of what to be consistent with. So, if you don't have one yet, <a href=""/resources/DuckPond/rules_rules_rules_why_brand_guides_are_important_to_nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">develop a brand guide</a>. A brand guide is more than a how-to manual on using your logo, colors, or templates (though this information should certainly be included). The most effective brand guides also articulate big-picture standards like your organization's <a href=""/blog/survey_says_lessons_from_the_brandraising_scorecard"" target=""_blank"">positioning and personality</a> as well as messaging elements including your vision, mission, key messages, and boilerplate text.</p>
<p>Your brand guide should be a resource for everyone at your organization, so make sure it's shared beyond the communications department. The more people understand and are excited about the brand, the more likely they are to use it correctly and consistently.</p>
<h3>2. Consider all communications.</h3>
<p>Chances are, you've put some thought into brand consistency on your website and brochures. But what about your office space? Or your Facebook posts? Or the person who answers your phones? Your brand doesn't just include the communications you develop intentionally--it's the impression left by every interaction people have with your organization. And if you're not using each of these opportunities to reinforce your brand, you could be sending some very mixed messages.</p>
<p>The diagram below (from Alina Wheeler's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Brand-Identity-Essential-Branding/dp/0470401427/ref=la_B001H6NV02_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347247112&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">Designing Brand Identity</a>) identifies several ways people might experience your organization. Put yourself in their shoes, examine each point of contact, and make sure they're all adding up to form a unified--and accurate--impression.</p>
<h3><img src=""file://localhost/Users/garcia/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image002.png"" /></h3>
<h3>3. Keep it fresh.</h3>
<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about consistency is that it leaves little room for creativity. The truth is anything but. A well-defined brand provides a consistent framework within which you can get as creative as you want. Just think of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/Target"" target=""_blank"">any ad campaign for Target</a>. Their communications team is continually coming up with fun, fresh ideas, and yet they're all unmistakably, well...Target. And that's the true value of consistency done well--when people see something new you've done and instantly recognize it as a communication from your organization.</p>

If the answer is ""not very,"" you're in good company.</p>
<p>We asked over 600 nonprofit professionals about their audiences through our <a href=""/resources/scorecard"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising Scorecard</a>, and the answers made it clear that there's a lot of room for improvement. Only about a third of the organizations had done some research to understand their audiences better, and less than half feel that their nonprofit chooses communications channels strategically to best reach their audience.</p>
<p>If you want to communicate effectively, it's important to know who you're talking to. But deep audience research and testing are prohibitively expensive (and time-consuming) for many nonprofits. How can you bring a focus on real people into your communications without breaking the bank?</p>
<p>Developing audience personas can be a great place to start. <strong>Audience personas</strong> are fictional profiles of typical members of your target audience, and they can be very useful tools in your communications. The idea is to remind yourself that there are real people on the other end of that email or that newsletter, and that you should send it with their motivations and needs in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of the top three key audience groups that you want to reach through your communications.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""2"">For each of those groups, think of two actual people who might be a part of your audience. They might be imaginary, but it's generally most useful to base it on a real person who's connected to your organization. (In fact, if you can, you may even want to interview that person and build the profile around their answers.)</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""3"">Give each person a name and note key facts about their background and who they are (e.g. age, gender, race/ethnicity, location, employment, education, interests, preferred ways to communicate, etc.).</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""4"">For each person, answer the following questions: how did she find or connect with us? What is she looking for from us? What are we looking for from her?</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""5"">Write up your personas, one per page, and give each one a photo. Share the document with key communicators at your organization.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li value=""6"">Keep those personas nearby--you may even want to hang a shortened version up on the wall near your computer. As you write and create and plan, use them to check yourself: am I thinking about what matters to Julie? Have I considered whether this piece is really relevant for Sam?</li>
</ol>
<p>Audience personas aren't a substitute for research, but they can be a great way push yourselves to consider things from a supporter's point of view.</p>

<h3 class=""alt"">Build it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Begin at the beginning: what does a good website look like? Claire Axelrad of Clairification writes about<a href=""http://clairification.blogspot.com/2012/02/theres-no-place-like-home-bring-your.html"" target=""_blank""> the growing importance of building a truly interactive, social site</a> (spot the ducks!).</li>
<li>Take a good, hard look at your website with <a href=""http://www.anngreennonprofit.com/2012/07/get-organized-this-summer-update-your.html"" target=""_blank"">Ann Green's checklist</a> in hand, one page at a time--maybe you'll discover that the moment is right for a refresh.</li>
<li>Remember what websites looked like back in 2001? Pamela Grow reminds us that even though the web has come a long way, <a href=""http://www.pamelagrow.com/2654/when-comes-nonprofits-website-kiss/"" target=""_blank"">it's important not to let the technology intimidate you</a> (or push you to overcomplicate things).</li>
<li>Wireframing is an important step in designing an effective website. <a href=""http://smartcausedigital.com/articles/wireframe-your-way-website-success"" target=""_blank"">Yesenia Sotelo on Smart Cause Digital will walk you through the whys and hows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Maintain it</h3>
<ul>
<li>As Lori Halley on Wild Apricot Blog puts it, ""keeping website content current or fresh is truly mission critical."" Check out her <a href=""http://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2012/09/21/3-tips-for-keeping-your-website-fresh"" target=""_blank"">practical tips for keeping your site up-to-date</a> without breaking the bank or making yourself crazy.</li>

<li>The best way to improve your website is to measure its performance and make changes based on what you learn. Louie Herr on The Communications Network talks you through the process of <a href=""http://www.comnetwork.org/2012/09/moving-from-web-analytics-to-web-evaluation/"" target=""_blank"">turning website data (like Google Analytics) into valuable insights</a>.?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">And don't forget...</h3>
<ul>
<li>...your mobile visitors. Andrew Edwards at Ethical Studios has put together <a href=""http://www.ethicalstudios.com/en/blog/mobile-websites-guide-nonprofits"" target=""_blank"">a great post outlining the pros and cons of different mobile-friendly options</a>.

<li>...the legal stuff. Privacy policies and accessibility standards may not be top of mind when you think about crafting your site, but they're very important. Erin McClarty has put together <a href=""http://www.notationsonnonprofits.com/education/when-developing-and-maintaining-a-website-dont-forget-the-legal-stuff/"" target=""_blank"">a useful list of legal concerns you should keep an eye on</a>.</li>

Looking to deepen your engagement on good ol' Facebook or Twitter? Read on for ideas you can implement right now on five of the most popular channels.</p>
<h3>Facebook</h3>
<p>How's your cover photo? You do have a cover photo, right? The cover photo is one of the stars of Facebook's Timeline design and it's a stellar opportunity to put compelling content front and center on your page. And you can swap it out on a regular basis to reflect whatever campaign you're working on at the time. For a great example, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InternationalRescueCommittee?ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">check out the IRC's page here</a>.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>If you haven't hosted a Twitter chat yet, try it! It's fun and easy. Just pick a time, topic, and hashtag, spread the word, and go for it! One way to provide new and interesting content for your followers is to get a subject matter expert who can answer questions on a certain topic. Even a simple Q&amp;A for an hour with your executive director offering a behind the scenes look at what you do could be compelling. Just don't forget to hashtag all of your tweets and archive them with a <a href=""http://tweetchat.com/"" target=""_blank"">tool like TweetChat</a>.</p>
<h3>Instagram</h3>
<p>If you're not on Instagram because you think it's just another stand-alone social network and you don't have the time or resources to invest in it, think again. There's no better tool for simultaneously posting photos to Twitter and Facebook in one fell swoop - not to mention, just about any photo looks great with one of those filters. Try using it as your primary photo tool, and I think you'll be surprised by how much time it saves you and your team. And don't forget to use hashtags in your photo descriptions, so they can be seen by a wider audience than just your followers.</p>
<h3>Foursquare</h3>
<p>Beyond claiming your office venue and leaving tips so people who visit get asked to donate, you can also <a href=""https://foursquare.com/create_page"" target=""_blank"">create an organizational page</a>, which functions a lot like a personal Foursquare account would. You can customize it with your branding, people can follow you, and you can leave tips at relevant venues. Get creative with the tips you leave - are you a health-related organization? Consider leaving tips about good eating habits at a grocery store. The sky's the limit, and don't be afraid to look outside your geographic area!</p>

<p>While we're all in a wait-and-see mode with Google Plus, it's still fun to experiment with some of their tools. If you're already on Google Plus, <a href=""https://plus.google.com/"" target=""_blank"">why not try a Hangout?</a> This group video chat tool is a cost-effective way to communicate face to face with your supporters, and to really build a community around your issue. <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+whitehouse/posts"" target=""_blank"">Try having a Q&amp;A session like the White House features on a regular basis.</a> It doesn't cost anything, so it can't hurt to have a little fun figuring out what works.</p>
<p>So now it's your turn. How has your organization been experimenting with any of these new tools? And has anything been super successful (or an epic failure)?

It’s a cliché we’ve all heard and understand. But in the nonprofit world, the relationship between time and money is not always so straightforward. You might have volunteers and other non-monetary resources available to you, and your hard work translates into a gradually better world -- a tricky thing to quantify on an hourly basis.</p>","<p>Time is money. It’s a cliché we’ve all heard and understand. But in the nonprofit world, the relationship between time and money is not always so straightforward. You might have volunteers and other non-monetary resources available to you, and your hard work translates into a gradually better world -- a tricky thing to quantify on an hourly basis.</p>
<p>Here at Big Duck, we track our time on every work-related task we complete (down to the second, if you’re one of our meticulous project managers) mostly because it’s the best way to know how much to bill for the communications work we do.</p>
<p>Coming from working in communications and development at a small nonprofit (that was often pressed for both time and money), converting to the magical world of time tracking was a bit of a paradigm shift when I started at Big Duck. Before, pausing to record the fact that I spent 17 minutes unsubscribing people from the mailing list might have seemed like an impractical chore.</p>
<p>But if you commit to tracking your time consistently, you’ll end up with some pretty telling data about where your time is being spent—and where it might make sense to reallocate it—at the end of the year. When it comes to your communications, the ability to smartly allocate your precious time (instead of spending it jumping over hurdles like inconsistency or lack of a communications strategy) can ultimately have an impact on how effectively you achieve your mission.</p>
<p>For example, are you reinventing the wheel every time you email your list because you haven’t agreed on your key messages or trained your team on using them correctly? Are you investing enough time into making sure people at all levels of your organization (from interns to the board chair) know how to use your elevator pitch and other elements of your messaging platform consistently? If you have in-house designers or writers, is it easy for them to use your logo and color palette or organizational positioning, or are they often creating materials from scratch or with vague strategy? Do your external materials, like public-facing vision, mission and values statements, change depending on your audience or who’s writing about them?</p>
<p>Tracking your time could yield an indication of how effectively and efficiently your communications efforts are stacking up. In fact, when I talk to prospective clients, a common woe often comes up: when your communications machine is broken, rusty, or inconsistent and you’re developing written or visual materials without some sort of foundation, everything winds up taking longer than it should.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to nerding out in just a few months when January rolls around on how my time’s been spent this year and thinking about how I might shift things around next year to accomplish more.</p>
<p>Where is your organization on the money-time continuum? Do you track your time, and have you used the data to identify strengths and weaknesses in your communications efforts?

It was only a lack of time that kept me from watching the video.</p>
<p>So I finally watched, and it is, of course, great. The video, obviously a few years old, is a lecture John Cleese gave about creativity. Included in the speech are his top five things you need for creativity.</p>
<p>Two of the five things are time.</p>
<p>Remember how it was lack of time that got in my way of watching it? Oy. Not a good sign for a creative professional.</p>
<p>Time--whether a perceived lack of or an actual lack of--is a constant battle for us nonprofiteers. Overworked and understaffed. It's our lot in life.</p>
<p>And I should point out that it's not just writers and designers who need to be creative in the workplace. Leaders need creative time. And service providers. And fundraisers. Really, if you want to improve in your position--no matter what your position--you need to be thinking creatively. Which means you need time.</p>
<p>The brandraising work we do here at Big Duck takes time. On the creative side of the work--logos and taglines, especially--it's the quality of the time that matters. Concentrated, uninterrupted, significant chunks of time.</p>
<p>And time away. Time away is also a treasured friend in the creative process.</p>
<p>Yet time is only part of what makes for great creative work. And I could talk about it for hours.</p>
<p>Segue alert!</p>
<p>Design Director Sonny Mui and I will be doing just that next week. We'll be discussing the creative process behind nonprofit logos and taglines.</p>
<p>So watch the John Cleese video&nbsp;and come to our workshop&nbsp;next week. We'd love to discuss the creative process with you a little in person.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1416%1","","","","creativity_and_time","creativity copywriting","creativity copywriting","<p>Image by left-hand (Flickr)</p>",

<p>Do the words data and measurement scare you a bit? Don't worry - it isn't as scary as it seems. <a href=""https://twitter.com/kanter"" target=""_blank"">Beth Kanter</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/kdpaine"" target=""_blank"">Katie Delahaye Paine</a>&nbsp;explain it all in their new book <a href=""http://measurenetworkednonprofit.org/"" target=""_blank"">Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World.</a> Last week a bunch of Ducks headed over to the book release at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/165880058617/"" target=""_blank"">501TechNYC</a> to hear from the authors.</p>
<p>Beth and KD explained that whether your nonprofit is already using social media or is still trying to figure out which tools make sense for you, harnessing the power of data and measuring that data are key to creating big impact through social media networks. To be a success, your nonprofit must be networked, be data-informed, and use measurement.</p>
<p><br />Here are my key takeaways from their great discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define your strategy, then pick your tools.</strong> You need to know your goals, audience, and what you are trying to measure before you pick a tool.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead with a networked mindset.</strong> Think collectively, develop your networks, and integrate data into your organization's way of doing things. This is a cultural shift, not a program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crawl, Walk, Run, Fly.</strong> Beth and KD use <a href=""http://fdncenter.visibli.com/share/WL2eJS"" target=""_blank"">this model</a> to outline the stages that a nonprofit takes to become more networked, data-driven, and measurable. Baby steps are okay - we all start with them. Even little ducks don't start flying right away - <a href=""http://youtu.be/05SQbprqz98"" target=""_blank"">they have to learn.</a> The key is to keep moving forward and keep learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask why, why, why.</strong> It isn't enough to just observe your data, you have to understand it. Measuring your data helps you make sense of it. It is great that your Facebook traffic went up last week, but you have to understand why it went up. Beth and KD's advice: ask why 3x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Listen to your data and learn from it.</strong> If the data shows that the event you plan every year just isn't getting results, stop doing it. As Beth and KD put it, ""stop doing stupid stuff."" It is ok to fail. Your organization can learn a lot from its failures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5 stages of measurement acceptance.</strong> Are you in denial that measuring your data is important? Perhaps you are afraid - after all, this involves numbers! Or maybe a bit confused about how to do all this. You're not alone. According to Beth and KD, there are 5 stages to accepting the importance of measurement: denial, fear, confusion, delight, and data-informed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Networking and measurement require time and investment.</strong> People and knowledge are key to making it all happen.</p>

<p>As explained by <a href=""http://www.thenetworkforgood.org/t5/Be-Your-Donor-Day/What-is-Be-Your-Donor-Day/td-p/9689#.UIfmvWnuUkU"" target=""_blank"">Network for Good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you send your next appeal, before you drive donors to your website and before you launch your year-end plans, you absolutely must set aside time to put yourself in your donor's shoes to guarantee that your fundraising strategy will inspire them to give more. This year, we decree that October 24th&nbsp;be that day: Be Your Donor Day!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been a lot of great blog posts marking this joyous occasion with tips and resources. We wanted to celebrate with some ideas of our own. So without further ado, here are 11 ways you can tell if your donor loves your organization:</p>
<p><strong>1. She spends her money and her time.&nbsp;</strong>Sure she makes a monetary donation, but she loves you so much she also volunteers for your organization. She may even serve on your board.</p>
<p><strong>2. She gives to you on a regular basis.&nbsp;</strong>Getting her to give that first time is hard, getting her to give a second time is harder, but can you get her to give to you every year or month? If someone is a sustainer, chances are they really love ya.</p>
<p><strong>3. She acts when you ask, and asks when you act.</strong> People who take action with you (alerts, petitions, etc.) are much more likely to donate. And I'd venture to say, that if she donates AND takes action, you've got a keeper. Bonus points for when she tells all her friends about what you are up to via email, Facebook posts, tweets, etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. She raises money for you too.</strong> Not only does she give to you, but she's happy to get others to join her. She may donate her birthday for or participate in a run/walk/ride endurance event. Along the way, she asks the people who care about her to support your nonprofit on her behalf. Why not flatter her back with a feature about her geneorsity in a profile in your next enewsletter or blog post?</p>
<p><strong>5. She reads what you send</strong>. You've put a source code on that direct mail reply card or a trackable URL in your annual report or email blasts for a reason. Your super donor opens and clicks on your emails, and may actually thumb through what you publish.</p>
<p><strong>6. She answers when you call.</strong> You call her right? Whether you've got a formal telemarketing program or have your executive director or board members call your major donors, she really appreciates that extra touch. And if she calls your organization, you are sure to answer the phone with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>7. She comes to your parties.</strong> Whether you throw a swanky gala, an educational breakfast, or an engaging conference, she is happy to mix and mingle with you, fellow donors, and other participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. She wears it on her sleeve. </strong>If you sell t-shirts, totebags, and other swag, she's happy to buy it. She may also use your logo as her avatar in social media profiles or feature your latest campaign as her Facebook timeline cover photo.</p>
<p><strong>9. She knows where her money goes.</strong> She never questions what percent of her donation goes directly to programs or how you allocated her gift, because you tell her. You feature this info in your annual report, on your website, and in personalized email updates. You might even send her a video that shows her dollars at work.</p>
<p><strong>10. She thinks giving to you is easy.</strong> She can figure out where and how to donate to you without a problem. And when she gives, it's quick and painless. She may even give to organization like yours, but thinks you do it best.</p>
<p><strong>11. She talks about what you do.</strong> You didn't think I'd leave out a mention of branding, did you? So yes, she gets the big idea of who you are, because your communications are so clear, compelling, and consistent. She may even rattle off the same elevator pitch that your staff does, because she's heard it over and over.</p>
<p>So--got anyone that fits this bill?&nbsp;Who are your super fans, your <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belieber"" target=""_blank"">Beliebers</a>, your people who just can't get enough of supporting your mission and your organization?

<p>Here are three tips to help you start writing engaging status updates:</p>
<h3>1. State your conclusion</h3>
<p>Don't be afraid to lead off with the most important thing you want the reader to take away. The more tangible and clear you are with what your readers are going to learn, the faster they are able to connect to the content. Including numbers or statistics in headlines, Facebook updates, or tweets have statistically higher click through rates. Readers know exactly what they are going to get out of spending their time reading your article.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; Put your readers first</h3>
<p>Make sure the language is jargon free and audience-centric. Will someone who has never heard of your organization or doesn't know anything about your work understand what you're saying? Focus more on what's helpful for your different audiences and what they're looking for and less on the fact that you wrote it.</p>
<h3>3. Use images on Facebook, hashtags on Twitter</h3>
<p>On networks like Facebook, Pinterest, and Instragram photos always win out. Using good imagery on your blog or newsletter not only make it more visually appealing, but also help when sharing. Post the same photo from your article on Facebook and include a link back to the article to drive traffic to your content.&nbsp; On Twitter and Instagram, use a hashtag to connect your article to a conversation already taking place. Hashtags can help you connect to others in your space talking about similar topics, give context to the greater article, or connect it to other content or campaigns your organization is already running.</p>
<p>Just remember that your followers on Twitter are expecting something different from the people that like you on Facebook. Facebook users don't want to see hashtags and your Twitter followers don't want you to waste space with full URL's. Instead of auto-feeding those updates across all platforms, write new messages for each one. You'll see a difference.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2063%1,1412%2","","","","one_article_many_ways_three_tips_on_how_to_share_your_content_through_different_platforms","social-media online","social-media online","",

But how do you get started?</p>","<p>So you've decided to experiment with social fundraising this holiday giving season. You've done your homework, picked a tool, and you're chomping at the bit to get your supporters raising money on your behalf. But how do you get started?</p>
<p>Here are three essential tips for success:<br /><br /><strong>1. Get specific!</strong> This tip will help you no matter what kind of fundraising you're taking on, but it's especially important for social fundraising. The campaign can raise money for a discrete project or program at your organization, or for an event like a charity run, or it can be a goal that you set to reach by a certain date. But campaigns without specifics and deadlines will fizzle and burn out, and you'll have a harder time getting your supporters revved up for round two.<br /><br /><strong>2. &nbsp;Be a force multiplier.</strong> Sure, your supporters have their own networks they'll be reaching out to, but what about your organization's social media properties? During the campaign, give shoutouts to your fundraisers on Twitter, feature successful pages on Facebook, or even profile a fundraiser or two on your blog. Show your supporters that you're paying attention, and that their work is meaningful.<br /><br /><strong>3. Incentive, incentivize, incentivize.</strong> You know what people like more than warm and fuzzies? Free t-shirts and beer koozies. Now, I'm not saying your fundraisers are in it for the swag, but it can't hurt. Make it a friendly competition, and offer a prize to the top-performers in the campaign. You want to give people that extra boost so they decide to fundraise instead of just donating and calling it a day, and that extra work should be rewarded.<br /><br /><em>Bonus tip: Don't forget to say thank you to your fundraisers, whether they haul in $5 or $5,000.</em></p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1413%1,1067%2,1405%3","Blog | Tips for social fundraising","","","social_fundraising_done_right","fundraising duck-pond campaigns social media advocacy","fundraising campaigns social awareness list building","<p><span>Photo by sparta644 (Pixabay)</span></p>",

In theory, I could comfortably stand in a freezing rain storm for days on end, whittling a variety of sticks with an array of sharp implements. Sounds pretty awesome right?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Having outdoor gear is great for the obvious reasons (whittling), but it's also helpful to have when say, a massive hurricane whips up. Oddly enough, none of it got much use this past week. As Sandy plowed through the east coast I was one of the lucky few that had power, water, heat, and (with a tinge of guilt), unencumbered internet access... for the entirety of the storm.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With my super stream of news via New York 1, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, I learned quickly that we were extremely fortunate considering what else was unfolding only a few miles away. The strangest of which was captured in this otherworldly photo of Jane's Carousel just a few blocks from my office. This is a place where I usually sit and eat lunch.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Two days after the storm, as people flocked to ATM power outlets to get their phone's working, I stumbled into these guys. They were burning wood scraps in hi-tech stoves, magically converting fire into electricity; obviously wizards of some kind.</p>
<p class=""p1""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/941309f5aeabd308f4fcc1da60f20f7a/files/nat_guard.jpg"" width=""530"" height=""398"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">The company is <a href=""http://www.biolitestove.com/"" target=""_blank"">BioLite</a> and they make stoves that generate power from biomass; ie. pine cones, twigs, wood. They also make <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/biolitestove"" target=""_top"">a larger stove</a> meant to replace polluting and dangerous cooking fires in developing countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/941309f5aeabd308f4fcc1da60f20f7a/files/charge.jpg"" width=""530"" height=""710"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">While boiling water for French press coffee, these guys were charging iPhones for anyone with a need. There were so many things New York about what was happening, my head nearly exploded. Coffee and iPhone charging on the street from wood scraps, yes, but also the device and the gesture all had that familiar vibe: New Yorkers cannot and will not be stopped. We will clean up and rebuild... and drink our damn coffee too. Obviously, I will be buying one.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","","","","","dumbo_recovers_with_a_little_help_from_biolite","technology sandy Dumbo biolite","","",

<p>A nonprofit's vision and mission statement hopefully provides a clear goal, but not always the strategy for how you'll get there. And need I say that working in an under-resourced environment (eg less staff and money than you really need) often results in tactical, reactive ways of working? Most nonprofits are so busy trying to get through the day they rarely make the time to talk about strategy.</p>
<p>Presidential candidates have budgets, strategists, staff, and visibility nonprofits can only dream about. We watch them advertise, email, speak for months in this practice called 'campaigning', and then we debrief about it. What can we learn from these campaigns despite the obvious difference in scale?</p>
<p>For me, the biggest lesson is about the power of a smart strategy. There were a lot of strategies layered into this race. A&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=164582496&amp;m=164582475"" target=""_blank"">clip on NPR this morning</a>&nbsp;with Cokie Roberts talks about one critical strategy: how President Obama's campaign appealed to emerging voter groups (particularly Latinos, which broke 71% for Obama). It seems a lot of people,&nbsp;<a href=""http://jezebel.com/5958355/mike-huckabee-thinks-the-gop-is-pathetic-at-reaching-out-to-minorities"" target=""_blank"">even Mike Huckabee</a>, think Romney's campaign failed to rally minorities.</p>
<p>Tactics, the actions you take, are expressions of that strategy. With a clear strategy in place you can decide where to place your emphasis: who gets what and how to prioritize. It's hard to take the time to set up a strategy- but once you do, it helps to chart a clearer path that guides all your actions, and sets up a framework that everyone can rally behind.</p>
<p>So next time you are ready to launch your own campaign--take the time to explore ideas that will help you achieve your goal, speak your audience's language and inspire them to act.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","1405%1","","","","goals_strategies_and_tactics_what_your_nonprofit_can_learn_from_this_election","Campaigns strategy Obama nonprofit-communications Election-2012","Campaigns strategy","",

It's not an easy situation to be in for anyone. Knowing how to get your message out and how to get support will help position you out in front the next time something like Sandy roars ashore (although hopefully not anytime soon!).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Get on the same page and be nimble.</h3>
<p>Make sure that your staff is all kept up to date on your communications plan, and that they have a clear understanding of your messaging. The last thing you need is a rogue tweet or Facebook post because someone wasn't in the loop. A communications chain of command can be helpful in these instances, so everyone knows who they're charged with informing. And if your organization is large and bureaucratic, figure out a way for information and approval to flow more quickly, so that you can stay nimble and responsive.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Consider your timing.</h3>
<p>Strike while the iron's hot, but not so soon that it looks like you're capitalizing on a crisis. It's a tricky balance, but the key is to wait until you have a good handle on the information available before making anything external. No matter what you choose to do, let it sit for at least an hour or two to make sure it feels thoughtful and responsive, rather than reactive and out of touch. Above all, don't reach out to people who have been directly impacted by the disaster, or it will come across as tone deaf. The last thing people from Staten Island or New Jersey needed last week was an ill-timed fundraising ask.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Be specific.</h3>
<p>Don't use the crisis as an opportunity to do general fundraising for your organization (unless you have a particularly relevant mission). Instead, create a specific fund or give donors a tangible item or event to donate towards. Though it might seem counterintuitive, if you don't offer direct services, consider raising money for an organization that does.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Partner up.</h3>
<p>Reach out to other nonprofits, even those you view as 'competitors' and see how you can work together, whether through joint fundraising, or supporting each other's programs on the ground.This expands your reach, and will show your supporters that you're putting your own organization second to an overall relief effort. Partnerships can also give your supporters something to do besides just donate--consider the expanded volunteer opportunities that would open up with multiple organizations coordinating their effort, not to mention the efficiency you gain.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Close the loop.</h3>
<p>Keep your supporters and donors updated on the progress you're making in real time via email and on social media. This is where that online community you've worked so hard to build is going to prove its value. If you're accepting donations, show how the money is being spent with photos and videos. But be sensitive to the tone and frequency of your communications, so they don't feel too ""rah-rah"" or overwhelm your list. Finally, be sure you keep any disaster-relief donors segmented in your database so you both know how you acquired them, and know that they respond to specific and timely events.

(Yes. My dad was Don Draper.) Despite the glamour of three martini lunches and high-profile clients, he longed to write fiction, so he sold his agency and wrote spy novels full-time for the last decade of his life.</p>
<p>Writing every day is hard work, and it takes real discipline. To keep himself on task, my dad had a small sign on his desk that read, 'Write, Damn it, Write.' Most of my friends who've written books have found you've got to carve out regular hours for it, especially on top of other full-time work. People like <a href=""http://www.newfangled.com/mark_o_brien_blog"" target=""_blank"">Mark O'Brien</a> or <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/"" target=""_blank"">Katya Andresen</a> who both write books and blog regularly tell me they carve out time for bigger writing projects at least weekly, while blogging is a more daily activity.&nbsp; I try to follow that discipline, too.</p>
<p>Setting up that blog is just the beginning. If you're serious about it, you'll have to find the time to write regularly, maybe even daily.</p>
<p>I'm trying to keep my writing muscles in shape, and that takes time and commitment. I've found that when I force myself to write regularly, even if it's just for 10 minutes a day, I'm able to articulate my ideas faster, and I'm happier with my prose. The longer I go in between writing stints the harder it is--just like exercise. I try to avoid getting sucked in to Facebook, Twitter, or other distractions. If I need a treat, I do some personal writing to clear my brain instead.</p>

There's no video evidence (at least, none that my fellow Ducks have managed to find), but think Andy Bernard on The Office and you'll have a pretty good sense of what it was like.</p>","<p>Long ago in my checkered past, I was the musical director of my college a cappella group. There's no video evidence (at least, none that my fellow Ducks have managed to find), but think Andy Bernard on The Office and you'll have a pretty good sense of what it was like.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I'm not sure it quite counts as ""relevant experience"" on my resume, but I've discovered over the years that a cappella singing and nonprofit communications have quite a lot in common--at least when it comes to the strategies that help you succeed. Here are a few of my favorites:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your audience engaged.</strong><br />We sang a concert every week or so, and the contexts varied widely--from elementary schools to cocktail parties to retirement homes. It was my job to look at our repertoire and put together a set list that would get the audience paying attention and tapping their feet to the music, even if they didn't recognize or love every song.<br /><br />Well-crafted nonprofit messages are no different, really. You start by showing your audience that you speak their language and know what they're interested in, and then when you've earned their attention, you can share more and give them ways to get to know you better. (By the way--working this way meant that we almost never used the same set list twice. There were always some tweaks based on past experience to make it stronger or more appropriate for the specific audience. Useful guidance for nonprofit communicators, too.)<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>All together now...<br /><br /></strong>We sang without sheet music, so it was critical for us to all know the music in advance and be crystal clear on what parts we were expected to sing. Let me tell you from experience--it's pretty awkward when you start two different songs at the same time.<br /><br />It may not always be as immediately (or painfully) obvious when your nonprofit's communications are out of tune, but it's just as confusing to your audience. If they're not hearing consistent messages from everyone at your organization at every touchpoint, they won't be able to tell what song you're singing. And they probably won't recommend the show to their friends.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Choose songs (content) appropriate to the space (channel).&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>A small, intimate audience of a few people will probably be overwhelmed if you bellow a power ballad at them from three feet away, and your most subtle, sophisticated piece will get lost in a noisy auditorium full of restless twelve-year-olds. Sometimes your favorite song just isn't right for the space in which you're singing.<br /><br />Same goes for nonprofits choosing when and how to communicate your message. Email is probably not the best tool for sharing a wordy, complex breakdown of your theory of change, and your major donors are probably expecting more than 140 characters when they pick up your annual report. Think about the limitations (and opportunities) of the space in which you're communicating, and choose content that will really sing (pun intended).<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Every voice matters.<br /></strong>My group had 20+ members and egalitarian approach to solo assignments, which means everyone had a song to sing. To build a good group sound, we had to coach people as they learned new music and give them the support they needed to sound their best.<br /><br />Everyone in your organization is a communicator, on some level. Make sure they have the tools they need (e.g., key messaging points and clear visual guidelines) to represent you well--and feel confident and proud--every time they stand in front of an audience.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Enjoy yourself--and believe in your message.<br /></strong>Our best concerts, hands down, were the ones in which felt most confident and had the most fun. Enthusiasm and energy will bring even the most reluctant audience along, and an eager crowd will be quickly disappointed if your heart isn't in the performance.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />It's the same for you, nonprofiteers. If you really own the messages you're using and feel proud, impassioned, and clear, it will come across to your supporters. And they'll be excited to be a part of your work.</p>

What gets in the way is a great database.</p>
<p>I recently got this email from <a href=""http://fab.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fab</a>- a very neat online store I shopped at for the first time a couple of days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/16bd8dbc3e9af2619198ee0040c8ef3a/files/_resized/80_630_841_untitled.png"" width=""630"" height=""841"" /></p>
<p>As a new customer, I'm interested to hear more about sales and products at Fab, but perhaps not as regularly as a more avid shopper or someone with more time might. I love this audience-centric email they sent me; they're asking me how often I want to hear from them and making it easy for me to be in the driver's seat with how they communicate with me.</p>
<p>Pulling off an email like this requires a great Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system and the ability to adjust content in-house as a result of the information collected. Sure, the technology is there, but the time isn't for many nonprofits. Get ready, though; this type of communicating is going to become increasingly the norm for for-profits and nonprofits alike. I wrote about it <a href=""http://www.nten.org/articles/2012/getting-intimate-with-your-donors-fundraising-trends-of-2012"" target=""_blank"">in this article</a> on 2012 fundraising for the Nonprofit Technology Network.

Truth be told, the number one reason I go is because of the food--let's face it, the French have some serious gastronomic game.</p>","<p>I love visiting Paris. I've just returned from my third trip there, and it still astounds me on how much I learn with each visit. Truth be told, the number one reason I go is because of the food--let's face it, the French have some serious gastronomic game. But the other reasons are less gluttonous. There's something to be said about a culture that seems to <em>care</em> about how things are presented. Whether it's their language, fashion, or architecture, how things are communicated spoke a lot about the care they put into their craft--even to outsiders like myself.</p>
<p>Just look at the entrances to their metros:</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans01.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></p>
<p>So it came as a little bit of a shock that I noticed an eerie typographical invasion on many a Parisian storefront. Yes folks, the dreaded Comic Sans--my arch nemesis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans02.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans03.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans04.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans05.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></p>
<p>Almost every other block had Comic Sans represented. Now maybe I was blinded by my previous trips to the seeming newness of Paris to my virgin eyes. I'm sure Comic Sans was always there, like a latent infection. I think I even remember seeing them on labels of little jars of jams. But on this trip, their presence seemed a little...loud. And proud. Maybe there's a sense of irony there? Maybe they think it's funny, that this type doesn't even represent the quality inside their stores?</p>
<p>Who knows. And after having a chausson aux pommes from&nbsp;Blé Sucré<a></a><span>, I stopped thinking about it so much.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/37d4b60a40f1cd65e69c2d149c6296f6/files/lecomicsans06.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""457"" /></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>And when I returned home, I had this to cure any lingering typographical hard feelings:</p>
<p><iframe width=""500"" height=""281"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" mozallowfullscreen="""" src=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/18886355?badge=0"" webkitallowfullscreen=""""></iframe><a href=""http://vimeo.com/18886355"">EF - Live The Language - Paris</a> from <a href=""http://vimeo.com/albinholmqvist"">Albin Holmqvist</a> on <a href=""http://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>I don't mean purely in the sense of using a dictionary during Scrabble or taking a late night stroll through a park that closes early. I mean breaking the law, writing-style. Yep, there comes a day when every good writer needs to break the rules.</p>
<p>It's not that your English teacher was lying the whole time. It's just that the best writing doesn't always have much in common with the right grammar. In fact, sometimes breaking grammar rules can greatly improve your writing--especially when you're writing for a variety of audiences, or when you're writing something that's intended to be spoken, like an elevator pitch. Here's my take on the grammar rules that nonprofiteers should consider breaking.</p>
<h3>1. Let your prepositions dangle.</h3>
<p>Technically speaking, it's true: sentences really shouldn't end in a preposition. But there's nothing natural-sounding about something like, ""It is behavior up with which I will not put,"" grammatically sound though it may be.</p>
<p>This fall, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/27/which-language-and-grammar-rules-to-flout"" target=""_blank"">tackled grammar rules in an edition of Room for Debate</a>. When reading it, I stumbled upon this lovely quote: ""So many millions of writers have needlessly contorted their prose to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition.""</p>
<p>So true! And when we contort our sentences to avoid leaving a pesky preposition at the end, they sound, well, contorted. And that's no good.</p>
<h3>2. Beware the wicked <em>which</em>.</h3>
<p>Okay, so, <em>in which</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>where</em> are all relative pronouns. <em>When </em>and<em> where</em> are reserved for when you're referring to a time or a place, respectively. But sometimes we need to talk about things that are neither a time nor a place--television episodes, hypothetical or imagined worlds, for instance. And when that happens we're supposed to go with the good 'ole <em>in which</em> construction, which tends to make you sentences a bit clunky.</p>
<p>I'm about to go on a tangent here, because this one actually comes up a lot in the world of nonprofit communications. At Big Duck, we approach vision statements as a description of the better world you're building. The only thing is that a hypothetical, imagined, distant world is neither a time nor a place, meaning that--once again, technically speaking--you should really be talking about a world in which great things happen, not a world where everyone is healthy and happy.</p>
<p>An organization's vision is a public statement. It's a great way to connect with your audiences. If you're mostly trying to reach a less technical crowd, this might be a good place to deepen the connection by flouting the rules.</p>
<p>Top Nonprofits has a list of <a href=""http://topnonprofits.com/examples/vision-statements/"" target=""_blank"">30 exemplary vision statements</a>, and many of them are great, but--surprise, surprise--grammatically incorrect:</p>
<p>""A world where everyone has a decent place to live."" --Habitat for Humanity</p>
<p>""We envision a world where all people--even if the most remote areas of the globe--hold the power to create opportunity for themselves and others."" --Kiva</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you're writing primarily for funders or technical audiences, or if you work in a field that has you under the reign of the grammar police, it might be best to opt for some grammatically pristine, law-abiding language. (A rebel I may be, but I've still got respect for your audiences.)</p>
<h3>3. It's okay to split.</h3>
<p>Sometimes verbs are complicated. There are few things in the English language as contentious as the split infinitive, which we're all familiar with, thanks to Star Trek. Yep, many grammar specialists take issue with the ""to boldly go"" in ""to boldly go where no man has gone before."" ""Whatever,"" says me.</p>
<h3>4. Embrace the third-person.</h3>
<p>That we don't have a gender-neutral first-person pronoun in the English language is the bane of my writerly existence. This makes it rather difficult to deal with something along the lines of ""Each student is responsible for turning in his/her/their/one's homework."" As a subject, <em>each student</em> is singular, so we're not supposed to use <em>their</em>.</p>
<p>But when I step back to think about how we usually talk in, you know, real life--""I called my coworker."" ""What did they say?""--disobeying the grammar police and going with the third-person just seems inevitable. Even Jane Austen seems to agree with me on this one:</p>
<p>""Every body was punctual, every body in <strong>their</strong> best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen."" --<em>Emma</em></p>
<p>As usual, this really depends on how grammar-fussy your peeps are. By peeps, I mean, of course, your audiences.</p>
<p>So, now that I've gone on and on, I want to hear from you. What grammar rules do you like to break for the sake of some good writing?

I don't know about you, but as 2013 approaches, I'm getting them on all sides, asking my opinions on everything from websites to products to strategic priorities.</p>
<p>Planning to survey your supporters this year-end? Here are a few quick rules of thumb to help you gather useful responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Think carefully about who's getting your survey</strong>, and choose questions that are appropriate to how well they know you (and how much time they'll be willing to invest). New supporters, for example, may not know a lot about your programs yet, and even long-time participants or donors may have only a few minutes to spare for their responses.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make good use of your format</strong>. People will be completing your survey online, where attention spans are short and distractions myriad. It's a good time to ask simple, focused multiple-choice questions--and maybe not such a good time for questions that require a detailed, well-thought-out response. (It's also much harder to effectively process the data collected from 100 short essays than it is to review aggregate responses--worth keeping in mind for time-strapped nonprofiteers.)<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li dir=""ltr""><strong>Take it all with a grain of salt</strong>. Most of the time, when your nonprofit sends a survey to supporters, you'll hear back from a self-selecting audience: the people who have something to say, whether positive or negative. That means a huge chunk of your list isn't weighing in at all. There's still value in giving your community a way to share their ideas and offer insights, but it's important to remember that you're only seeing a part of the picture.</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, these are very informal guiding ideas--there's a lot of rigor to smart survey methodology and design.

Here's my take.</p>","<p>If you ask me, nonprofits will remember 2012 as a year when communities connected and mobilized with newfound moxie. With the help of data-informed personalization, online agility, and personality-driven movements, we saw big donations and big changes happening all over the place. Here's my take.</p>
<p><strong>1. The President knows the color of your underwear.</strong><br />Companies are compiling information about us in ways that will make you want to sell your computer, pack your VW camper bus, and live in the woods off the grid. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"">Target often knows when a consumer is pregnant</a> even before she's told her family. Using that data, they market specific products and attempt to make her a customer for life. Sure, big, fancy businesses have been collecting and leveraging personal information for a while now, but the rest of us, particularly nonprofits, simply couldn't afford to collect and analyze it. In 2012, however, we saw a rise in data collection and analysis being used to raise money and spark social change much closer to home.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Obama campaign knocked our socks off by integrating social networking and data collection into what most of us assumed would be election-year business as usual. In 2012, they took it much farther, building a mega-database that helped them target donors with sniper-like precision. &nbsp;For instance, did you know that George Clooney is catnip to women ages 40-49 who manage their family's paychecks? <a href=""http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/#ixzz2CJx07Au5"" target=""_blank"">Obama's data nerds</a> did. They also deduced that these women like Sarah Jessica Parker. Depending on where you lived, you could win a chance to dine with her or George. Really, this data is pure fundraising gold, and it helped the Obama campaign reach an almost inconceivable goal of 1 billion dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2012 presidential campaign is a great case study for how sophisticated data collection and analysis can inform fundraising. Sure, both parties had a team of data scientists working on this stuff for years, and you don't. But back in 2008 you probably didn't expect that social media would become a serious element of your organization's communications, either. Over time, we staff, budget and manage differently as new priorities emerge.</p>
<p>Good things come to those who wait for technology to become accessible and the trailblazing to become mainstream. But nonprofits like <a href=""http://www.stumbleupon.com/ads/blog/7-reasons-why-charity-waters-ad-inspired-and-delivered-using-paid-discovery/"" target=""_blank"">charity: water</a> and <a href=""http://www.socialbrite.org/2012/10/15/how-dosomething-uses-data-to-change-the-world/"" target=""_blank"">Do Something</a> are already mining data with sophistication and using the results to motivate volunteers, inspire gives, and spark action. You're next.</p>
<p><strong>2. Donors know what's stuck in your E.D.'s teeth.</strong><br />Another byproduct of social media is a newfound sense of intimacy with celebrities, notable personalities, and other people we generally put on pedestals. (Personally, following Ashton Kutcher or Lady Gaga on Twitter doesn't float my boat, but following <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoryBooker"" target=""_blank"">Cory Booker</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Atul_Gawande"" target=""_blank"">Atul Gawande</a>, and, of course, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ntenhross%20or"" target=""_blank"">Holly Ross</a> does.)</p>
<p>Once upon a time, gaining access to our heroes was hard work. Now we know what they're thinking about and working on in real time. This sense of standing side-by-side with leaders and innovators makes it easier than ever to spark movements and action of all kinds. When they talk, we're listening--and ready to do what they ask.</p>
<p>In 2012, we've seen executive directors of nonprofits of all sizes regularly using Twitter, Facebook, and video to break down the wall separating us from their work. Earlier in the year, Nancy Brinker (Founder and former CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure) and Cecile Richards (President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America) both used social media to connect with supporters during the controversy surrounding Komen for the Cure's decision to pull funding for breast cancer screenings from Planned Parenthood. &nbsp;Following a massive public backlash, the decision was reversed and, a few months later, Nancy Brinker stepped down as CEO. Planned Parenthood, on the other hand, raised <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/planned-parenthood-says-komen-decision-causes-donation-spike/2012/02/01/gIQAGLsxiQ_story.html"" target=""_blank"">$650,000 in just 24 hours</a>, $400,000 of which came in online.</p>
<p>Even the President broke down the third wall. Before this election, having dinner with the President and First Lady was a perk accessible only by invitation to luminaries and major donors. But data shows that middle-aged women who donate also love contests and intimate dinners, so dinners they got--and not just with George and Sarah. The &nbsp;""Dinner with Barack"" contest required a small donation--only $3 to $6--to enter. The Obama campaign hasn't disclosed how much this contest specifically raised, but it's clear they <a href=""http://www.obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2012/10/last-dinner-with-barack-helps-president.html"" target=""_blank"">contributed significantly</a> to the bottom line. (<a href=""http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-new-dinner-with-barack-video.html"" target=""_blank"">Videos of the dinners</a> were also released so the rest of us could see what an intimate meal with POTUS and FLOTUS includes.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Today is the new next month.</strong><br />It's not just the organizations and their leaders who are stepping up. Existing networks and communities (online and off) can also mobilize lightening-fast these days. It makes me laugh out loud to recall all the hours we spent wondering if certain donors would ever give online. First, we thought only the 'digital natives' could handle it. Then, gradually, we raised the age ceiling. These days, your grandma may not buy dinner with Google Wallet or Venmo yet, but odds are good she's game to make a donation online. She's already friended me on Facebook.</p>
<p>With the Sandy recovery effort, we saw nonprofits of all different shapes and sizes, not to mention individuals, mobilizing faster than you can say 'flashlight'. Occupy Sandy, an outgrowth of the Occupy Wall Street movement, had a site built, a '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/32TAA123PJR42"" target=""_blank"">wedding registry' on Amazon</a> you could use to donate relief supplies, and an archive to <a href=""http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/storyline/"" target=""_blank"">capture stories online</a> within a few days of the storm. You could also make a donation to one of many different organizations working on Sandy relief via <a href=""http://www.crowdrise.com/sandyrelief"" target=""_blank"">crowdrise.com</a> and have it matched by Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist), or donate $1, $5, or $10 as you checked out while shopping at Whole Foods. Online and off, ways to volunteer and donate are plentiful, and designed to make the donor's experience easy and fast. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of November 9, less than two weeks after the storm, <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/09/pf/red-cross-sandy-donations/"" target=""_blank"">the American Red Cross had already raised $117 million for Sandy relief</a>, from a combination of corporate support, individual giving (some via their text-to-give program), banner ads, and an NBC telethon and benefit concert. Having a highly regarded brand and a solid network of big relationships in place certainly helps, too.</p>
<p>With all of this increasingly affordable and user-friendly technology at our fingertips, motivated individuals can move mountains fast. Small, large, old, and new organizations are demonstrating speed and agility with their fundraising and crisis communications. I'm impressed--and, as a native New Yorker--very thankful.</p>
<p>So as you wrap up another year of working toward your mission, add a few things to your 2013 to-do lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect AND analyze data.</strong> Take what you learn and try new approaches informed by what you know about your supporters. Not sure what that means? Check out Beth Kanter and Katie Paine's new book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Networked-Nonprofit-Using-Change/dp/1118137604/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353947344&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=measuring+the+networked+nonprofit"">Measuring the Networked Nonprofit</a> for a jumpstart.</li>
<li><strong>Open up.</strong> Share more of who you are--from the executive director to the intern. Everyone represents your organization, and your supporters want to know you. Help and encourage them to represent you in ways that make sense based on who they are.</li>
<li><strong>Act fast.</strong> Hopefully 2013 will be a year that's free of crisis. But just in case, be prepared. Role-play how you'd handle a crisis before it happens, so you can respond quickly--and in multiple channels--if it does.</li>

It's some of my favorite work, because the findings never fail to challenge me--or to remind me that my gut can only take me so far when it comes to building a good online experience.</p>","<p>We Ducks just wrapped up several website projects that involved user testing. It's some of my favorite work, because the findings never fail to challenge me--or to remind me that my gut can only take me so far when it comes to building a good online experience.</p>
<p>So, how does user testing work? The basic idea is that we sit down with real people (the kind of the people who would actually visit the site), and watch them click around a website in response to prompts and tasks. Of course, a lot of rigor goes into trying to keep the experience consistent and avoid leading people with our questions, but at the core, it's pretty simple. And it gives you a glimpse of how your visitors&nbsp;actually&nbsp;behave online.</p>
<p>I'm a keyboard shortcut girl myself, so when I watch someone painstakingly navigate to the ""File"" menu and choose ""Print"" from the dropdown, I'm reminded that the pace at which I experience the web isn't universal. And after you watch the third or fourth person's eyes pass right over that bright-colored banner you created to promote your big event, you'll be ready to stop trusting your gut and start making some changes.</p>
<p>So if you really want to take your website to the next level, watch someone trying to use it. It doesn't have to be complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by finding 4 or 5 people who reflect the diversity of your audience in terms of age, web savvy, socioeconomic status, interest in your cause, familiarity with your work, etc.</li>
<li>Ask each person to sit down with you and go through the process of finding volunteer opportunities, or making a donation, or just figuring out what the heck it is you do.</li>
<li>Watch their mouses (where do they click? what content did they miss?) and their faces (what confused them? what intrigued them?).</li>
<li>Take notes on what you observe--if you can, you might even try recording it (we've used a service called <a href=""http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html"" target=""_blank"">Camtasia</a> that works well) so that you can play it back later.</li>
<li>Share your findings with a few colleagues, and spend 30 minutes brainstorming what changes you might make as a result of what you've found.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don't do a formal process with experts, I can just about guarantee you'll see something that you didn't expect, or run up against an interesting challenge or a new idea for a solution. Try it, and tell me what you learn--or if you've done a process like this before, tell us what you found in the comments.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, if you want to learn more about your own biases and opinions about what works online, I suggest subscribing to <a href=""http://whichtestwon.com/"" target=""_blank"">WhichTestWon's Test of the Week</a>: every week, they'll send you two different versions of a web page or email, and ask you to guess which one performed better. It's surprising how often the best practice can be wrong depending on the context and the audience.<br />&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2061%1,2063%2","","","","dont_trust_your_gut","user-testing website Online","user-testing website Online","<p><span>Photo by Hey Paul Studios (Flickr)</span></p>",

Wrong again.</p>
<p>""Delivering Happiness"" begins as a chronicle of Tony Hsieh's professional life (less personally relevent unless you went to Harvard and are a dot.com entrepreneur, but interesting none the less). But I really started paying attention when Mr. Hsieh begins to explain how Zappos' <a href=""http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values"" target=""_blank"">core values</a> were developed and how he sees them as a formal expression of his company's culture.</p>
<p>'Culture' is a hot topic these days. I've been theorizing for years that the organizations that get the most from the work we do at <a href=""/"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck </a>have a culture that is able to embrace and adapt to what a brandraising, campaign, or training engagement delivers. I've also noticed that organizations that embrace articulating, sharing, and living by their values often seem the healthiest: staffed by people who are passionate and engaged, making great strides in their work, and more. It's a bit like exercising and eating right: you start off because it's the right thing to do, and over time, the benefits are surprising and motivating.</p>
<p>Hsieh ends his book with a discussion about happiness and a bit of the research he's applied to zappos.com's relationships with their customers, staff and vendors. It's relevent for anyone who manages people, works with clients, or wants to be more intentional about their own happiness.</p>
<p>I'm going to do more thinking about these topics in 2013. If you are too, I suggest you check out the book, which is coming out in paperback in late March 2013, or is available now in hardcover.

<p><a href=""http://www.oxfam.org.uk/donate/donate-goods/gift-aid-your-goods"" target=""_blank"">Oxfam's Tag Your Bag scheme is pretty simple.</a> Oxfam wants people who donate their used belongings to sign up for Gift Aid (a UK government initiative that allows charities to reclaim the tax on donations from UK tax-payers). But to do that, you have to fill in a boring tax form every time you drop off your gently-worn <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/225228/mantyhose-are-men-really-ready-to-wear-tights"" target=""_blank"">mantyhose</a>, which declares you're a UK taxpayer and that you're happy for Oxfam to reclaim tax on your donation. Tag Your Bag cleverly lets you skip that step: Fill in a form once, get a sheet of labels with a unique identifier on them, stick one on your bag of dusty old <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-buzz/post/obama-hits-dc-streets-in-mandals/2011/06/20/AG1bpkcH_blog.html"" target=""_blank"">mandals</a> and BINGO. No more boring tax forms and the added warm, fuzzy feeling from knowing your donation is worth 28% more to the organization.<br /><br />And the really clever thing about it? The nice green labels give you a subtle nudge to donate to Oxfam every time you pass your pinboard. Their clear Oxfam-y branding keeps Oxfam at the top of your mind AND makes you feel even better about Oxfam because they made your life that little bit easier for you. Smart stuff.

<p>Getting donors to give to your organization is hard. And getting them to give again can be even harder--but worth it. With gifts from individuals still the highest source of income to nonprofits, it's essential that you balance efforts to attract new donors and grow your list with efforts to retain and engage your current supporters. In fact, fundraising researcher Adrian Sargeant found that ""improving donor retention by just 10% can double the lifetime value of your donor database."" (cited by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.afpnet.org/files/ContentDocuments/Donor_Retention_What_Do_We_Know.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Association of Fundraising Professionals</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><small>Photo credit: Good-wallpapers</small><br />So how do you capture those lovely LYBUNTs (Last-Year-But-Not-This-Year donors)? We suggest more strategic and more frequent or targeted communications (surprise!). Here are some approaches you&nbsp;should&nbsp;try at home:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Calculate your donor retention rate.</strong>&nbsp;Determine what percentage of all your donors last year were repeat givers. According to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.afpnet.org/files/ContentDocuments/FEP2012Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Fundraising Effectiveness Project</a>, nearly six out of every ten donors who gave to nonprofits in 2009 did not donate again in 2010. Are you retaining more than 40%? Understand how big of a problem you really have and look for differences in donor retention rates based on giving levels or sources.</li>
<li><strong>Audit your donor communications.</strong>&nbsp;Look at every email, letter, invitation, report, web page, blog post, and status update, as well as anything else you published in an effort to engage your donors. Keep track of the number of times you asked your community to donate. Then, track how often you shared news on the progress of their investment and results of your programs. Which number is higher? Donors want to feel like part of your success, not just the ATM behind it.</li>
<li><strong>Try new ways to thank donors for their support.</strong>&nbsp;A heartfelt and personal thank you or update about your work leaves donors feeling good. Plus, it shows that you care about them beyond their wallet. Take time now, early in the year, to create a new calendar and brainstorm what other communications you might need to send--which may also include calls and visits.</li>
<li><strong>Get (or reexamine) your systems for managing donor data.</strong>&nbsp;Using data to target and segment communications is essential to keeping your donors. There are lots of different options for how to do this and what systems to use. Not sure if you need to change your donor management or constituent relationship management (CRM) system? Start by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.idealware.org/reports/new-dm-workbook"" target=""_blank"">reading this handy report from Idealware and TechSoup</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your donors why they give to your organization.</strong>&nbsp;Find out what was behind that first or even tenth gift to your organization. Was it because a particular person asked them? Did they receive services or resources from you? If you're not sure what's motivating your donors, try asking them next time you see them, or schedule a few phone interviews. You can also send them a survey or experiment with posting a question on Facebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you do just one of these steps or all five of them, be sure to develop a new approach to retaining your donors. Sure, new friends are great, but it's the old ones you can really count on.</p>

I would simply suggest that you ask yourself if it's truly the most effective choice.</p>","<p>Gee, now that it's February, is it too late to think about words to avoid for 2013? Never, nonprofiteers. Never...</p>
<p>I'm including the usual annual caveats about this list of words, especially this: If any word on the list is truly the most effective choice for reaching your reader, please go ahead and use it. I would simply suggest that you ask yourself if it's truly the most effective choice.</p>
<p>And, with that, here are a few words that Big Duck recommends you avoid (or at least be fully conscious that you're using):</p>
<p><strong>Constituents</strong><br />I'm sure I've been guilty of using this one. It's just too familiar. But let's remember that unless you've been elected to office, you don't actually have constituents. You have participants, donors, friends, family, or any other word that describes your different audience members.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize</strong><br />This is one of those words nonprofits use because it sounds really good. <em>Optimize</em> means ""to make something the best."" Bold claim. Even bolder than making something better. We recommend that you just say what you mean. If there's genuinely nothing you can do to make something better, go ahead and consider it optimized.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem (when you don't mean actual ecosystems)</strong><br />This one, as a metaphor, has crept into the nonprofit world with aplomb over the past year. Directness is a trusted friend when communicating. Unless you want people to think about biological organisms living in an interconnected natural environment, you're likely to lose your reader or listener when you use <em>ecosystem</em> in another context.</p>
<p><strong>Interwebs, internuts, FaceSpace, etc.</strong><br />Some of you might remember 2004. During one of the presidential debates, President George W. Bush referred to the ""internets."" Ever since, nearly a decade later, the hipsters of Brooklyn (home of Big Duck) have embraced ironic terms that imply they don't know how the internet works. Boy, it sure rubs some of the Ducks the wrong way. On a mostly unrelated note, I live in Queens.</p>
<p><strong>Strive, help, work, etc.</strong><br />Big Duck is definitely guilty of using this group of words, and truth be told, there's nothing wrong with the words themselves. But they do encourage weak sentence construction. Nonprofits habitually avoid taking credit for the great work they do. It results in passive voice, or sentences like, ""We work to protect endangered species."" How about instead, ""We protect endangered species""? Please be careful in your use of these words.</p>
<p><strong>Synergistic</strong><br />Vomitastic.</p>
<p><strong>I've lost the war on <em>impact</em>.</strong><br />No amount of kvetching (and it's been <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/words-nonprofits-avoid-2010"" target=""_blank"">several years</a> of it) seems to have any impact on the totally unimpactful way that people use <em>impact</em>. I hereby throw in the towel (although I did keep my <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/blog/words_to_avoid_2012_edition"" target=""_blank"">2012 New Year's resolution</a> to get it out of <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/values"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck's values</a>, thanks to some good thinking by <a href=""http://www.bigducknyc.com/about/team/katherine_lindstedt"" target=""_blank"">Katherine</a>).</p>
<p>But if I admit defeat on this word, will you kind nonprofiteers at least agree not to use <em>impacts</em>, as a plural noun? I recently saw a sentence that went something like this: ""We've got a week of big impacts in front of us.""</p>
<p>Have we lost total control of our senses, people?! For the love of all that is holy in this life, it must not happen again! Will you grant me that much? Please? I'm actually begging you now.</p>
<p>You guys have any words you're planning to avoid this year? Tell us in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Credit where credit is due:</strong><br />As always, I received much input from colleagues before honing my list. You may (or may not) be surprised to learn that some of them have even stronger opinions about words than I do.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to check out The Lake Superior State University's <a href=""http://www.lssu.edu/banished/current.php"" target=""_blank"">annual list of banished words</a>. They always have a few excellent ones on their list. My favorites this year: <em>trending</em> and <em>boneless wings</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, a friend sent me a link to <a href=""http://jargonated.com/"" target=""_blank"">Jargonated.com</a> the other day. Lots of words to avoid in there. And if you click the ""jargon me"" button a few times, you might begin to wonder if they're not making fun of company names like Big Duck.

<p>With every new technology that emerges, there seems to be a corresponding slew of new recommendations on how best to re-engineer your brand. From social media to mobile to crowdsourcing to big data, technology trends place unrelenting demands on how resource-constrained nonprofits create branded experiences for their key stakeholders. And just when an organization catches up with the latest next big thing, the dominant technology paradigm shifts, and the organization is forced to revisit its approach to branding all over again. According to branding experts, however, the secret to establishing a strong brand is not to re-define your organization with every new technology trend, but rather to be consistent in your brand and to be flexible in how you use new technology to reinforce that brand.</p>
<p>Sarah Durham, principal and founder of New York City-based nonprofit communications firm&nbsp;<a href=""/"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck</a>, asserts that good branding starts with a strategy that is flexible enough to absorb the dynamic nature of technological change. ""We are living in an increasingly noisy world and are bombarded with messages,"" says Durham. ""All nonprofits need to be part of this communications stream. Because few nonprofits have the staff or communications capacity to negotiate all possible channels, nonprofits need to have a simple approach to communication across all media.""</p>
<p>According to Durham, the strength of a brand hinges on two factors: (1) being clear about the organization's position, and (2) expressing the organization's personality. Positioning is a term that often gets thrown about in discussions of an organization's stance relative to competitors, but it also indicates the position that an organization occupies in the mind of those who come into contact with the organization, be it in person, in the media, or online. The personality of an organization is reflected in the tone and style it uses to communicate with audiences.</p>
<p>Jennie Winton, founding partner of the San Rafael, Calif.-based nonprofit marketing communications consulting firm&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mission-minded.com/"" target=""_blank"">Mission Minded</a>&nbsp;states that ""brand"" is simply another way of saying ""reputation."" Winton views social media, mobile devices, and other new technology paradigms as divorced from this bigger idea of brand. ""Branding is really about the essence of the promise [that your organization delivers upon],"" says Winton. ""The tactical way that you reinforce that big idea or promise is through these new channels and technologies.""</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Avoid Tech Bandwagon Branding</h3>
<p>Establishing a strong brand requires consistency and clarity. For this reason, organizations are cautioned against jumping on the latest technology trend solely for its own sake. Winton calls this ""a tactic in search of a strategy."" Responding to pressure to keep up with others in the field, organizations will sometimes throw financial resources or personnel at a new technology strictly to have a presence.</p>
<p>For example, an organization may believe that its employees should be blogging, so it will require staff to write blog posts on the organization's website without providing a framework for how doing so should tie into the organization's mission. In other instances, the nonprofit's bloggers might be set loose without clear guidance as to how to write in a consistent tone and style that reflects the organization's personality. So before an organization starts posting photos on Instagram or building mobile apps or redesigning its website for tablet devices, it should think twice about how these activities support the brand strategy.</p>
<p>""Being innovative means taking appropriate advantage of new branding channels and using them in innovative ways,"" says Winton. ""Don't just do what everyone else is doing. Break the rules in a way that simultaneously is mission forward and that also reinforces your brand."" A think tank that has developed a brand that exudes a formal personality and a reputation for delivering measured, insightful analysis should not suddenly start tweeting brash, cheeky comments on Twitter. Likewise, an organization with a youthful, edgy personality should reflect this personality in their branding.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Brand for the Long Haul</h3>
<p>One community-based organization that has developed a vibrant local brand is&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.spyhop.org/"" target=""_blank"">Spy Hop Productions</a>, a youth media organization in Salt Lake City. ""Creating a strong brand is critical to our mission of mentoring young people,"" says Virginia Pearce, director of marketing and community programs at Spy Hop. ""This is the crowd that gets when they are being marketed to, so it is critical that our brand is honest and speaks to them individually.""</p>
<p>Spy Hop has developed a consistent brand that is reflected in all of the ways that it appears to different audiences, including youth participants, donors, and foundations. ""As we hone in on how we speak to our community as SpyHop, we find ourselves speaking in the same way and that is good for everybody,"" says Pearce. ""Obviously, when you're writing a grant it is very different than when you're talking to a teen, but there is a consistency in the personality of our brand as a cutting edge, creative, youthful, vibrant member of an arts community.""</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<a href=""http://earthjustice.org/"" target=""_blank"">Earthjustice</a>, a San Francisco-based nonprofit environmental law organization, having a strong brand is critical to the organization's success. ""The most important thing for a nonprofit is to make sure its brand speaks to its mission,"" says Earthjustice Marketing Director Nadine de Coteau. ""For us, brand is everything. Litigation is the core of what we do. We fight for the right for a healthy environment for all. Our brand is a fighter brand. It reflects optimism, partnerships, excellence and tenacity."" Branding at Earthjustice is about positioning the organization in the mind of the public such that they want to join the fight for the long haul and won't back down. ""Brand consistency is about brand integrity and brand democracy,"" says de Coteau. ""If the brand is true to the mission, it doesn't feel foreign to the organization. Our brand is not something separate and apart from what we are and what we do.""</p>
<p>While Earthjustice monitors new trends, it decides whether a new technology positions the organization strategically and whether their audience is there before embarking on a plan to use that technology. Maintaining consistency across the brand throughout new channels comes easy when the brand is activated throughout the organization. ""We do believe it is important to have a consistent style and tone, but we don't have a brand cop,"" says de Coteau. ""We have brand standards and templates, which is operational stuff. Our brand integrity is such that it's true to the organization and true to the people in the organization, so our attorneys often speak to the brand without even trying. We know what the real assets of our brand are and we don't mess with them too much.""</p>
<p>In many ways, technology has made branding more important than ever. Technology has enabled small organizations to be visible in places they couldn't have been before, but it has also created a more crowded playing field that forces organizations to cut through more noise just to be heard. A local arts organization isn't just competing with other local arts organizations. It's also competing with other nonprofits that are vying for the attention of the same patrons, donors, and volunteers. Good branding is about having a single, clear big idea that people can understand and fall in love with.</p>
<p>""Brands are for a lifetime,"" says Mission Minded's Winton. ""Your brand should not be changing with the developments with the technology. The brand has to be rock solid and not shifting. The way you communicate your brand is based on what comes along next.""</p>

<p>Every month, my three podmates and I get together for a 15-minute Music Book Club. Music Book Club, you ask? Well, it's a VERY innovative microbreak/bookclub/show-and-tell fusion model, in which we each present a song or two within a selected theme (example: ""Sad-sounding songs that are actually happy""), discuss, analyze, argue about Billy Joel, and discover the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it sounds a little silly, but making time to goof off or--if you're a bit more serious than my podmates--exercise your brain on something interesting but not entirely work-related can really enhance your work culture and enrich your brand.</p>
<p>Music Book Club, as unrelated to nonprofit communications as it may be, helps reinforce for my podmates and me that our team is made up of fun, smart, and creative people who value the unique perspectives each of us brings to the table. Hopefully, that comes across when you interact with any of us Ducks, and that's an expression of our brand.<br /><br /> Your organizational culture is a component of your brand. It emerges in any of your interactions with the people who help advance your organization's mission, including donors, program participants, and media. Does your organization have any practices to help give your brain a rest from the daily grind? If so, how does it relate to or reinforce your personality or brand?

<p>Many nonprofiteers are trying to figure out the best way to use online tactics and integrate them with offline tools to mobilize communities and create real social change. <a href=""https://twitter.com/amyrsward"" target=""_blank"">Amy Sample Ward</a> from <a href=""http://www.nten.org/"" target=""_blank"">NTEN</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/WomenWhoTech"" target=""_blank"">Allyson Kapin</a> from <a href=""http://www.radcampaign.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rad Campaign</a> provide great guidance on how to do this in their new book: <a href=""http://socialchangeanytimeeverywhere.com/"" target=""_blank"">Social Change Anytime Everywhere: How to Implement Online Multichannel Strategies to Spark Advocacy, Raise Money, and Engage your Community</a>.<br /><br />At this month's <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/165880058617/"" target=""_blank"">501 Tech NYC</a>, Amy shared some insights on how to plan and carry-out effective online multichannel campaigns, generating a great conversation that a <a href=""https://twitter.com/bigduck/status/304375813661392896"" target=""_blank"">paddle</a> of us Ducks are still quacking about.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/img_1955.jpg"" style=""width: 535px; height: 401px;"" /><br /><br />Here is a recap of some of the information Amy shared from the book:</p>
<p><strong>Your supporters are your superheroes!</strong> As champions of your cause, your supporters make change happen. You can enable them to be superheroes by reaching them wherever they are and helping them to take action.<br /><br />People are increasingly going mobile!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">There are 5.2 billion mobile accounts worldwide.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">1 in 2 mobile subscribers in the U.S. has a smartphone.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you need to reach your supporters wherever and whenever they are open to it. It could be that they are reading email on their desktop, checking Facebook on their phone while in line to buy coffee, and/or using their laptop to tweet on an airplane thanks to that new 35,000 feet-up wifi. Yup, your supporters fly and tweet - that's superhero stuff. If you are not sure where to reach your supporters, ask them.<br /><br /><strong>Not everything is a campaign.</strong> Your mission and all of your work are not a campaign. Figure out what your community cares about in relationship to what you care about - make your campaign about that.<br /><br /><strong>Focus in on your shared goals.</strong> Identify the issues, services, and programs you work on that your supporters care the most about - what are the hot topics? Identifying these will help you decide the framework of your campaign. Again, if you are not sure, ask your supporters.<br /><br /><strong>Design for distribution.</strong> From the very beginning, plan for all of your content to be distributed across multiple channels and make everything shareable.</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/jcbivins/status/304374225777598464"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/screen_shot_2013-02-25_at_10.10.00_am.png"" style=""width: 483px; height: 228px;"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cross channel promotion.</strong> Bring offline communications online to more deeply engage people.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid campaign kryptonite.</strong> It is easy to ""do it wrong, quickly."" To prevent this, focus on one objective, not ten and don't try to please everyone - donors, all targets, staff, etc. Finally, don't forget who your superheroes are.....<br /><br /><a href=""https://twitter.com/lauraecole/status/304382052105596929"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/images/blog/screen_shot_2013-02-25_at_10.12.25_am.png"" style=""width: 481px; height: 199px;"" /></a><br /><br />Once you have determined that you are in fact campaigning, here are a steps to do it successfully:&nbsp;</p>
<h4>8 Steps to Creating a Multichannel Campaign Plan</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify your short-term and long-term goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify your targets - both supporters and advocacy targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craft your message &amp; define the message hook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out what actions you want people to take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how your supporters think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how they want to be involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a campaign calendar and follow it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out how to reach people in all online communities.</p>

They want to help you do your job well, but they may not really understand how to do that without crossing the line between governance and management.</p>","<p>Chances are, your board is looking for details that help them feel they've done right by the organization. They want to help you do your job well, but they may not really understand how to do that without crossing the line between governance and management.</p>
<p>And let's face it: Board meetings can be, well... boring. Many board members don't communicate. Those who do often want data, information, and detail that you must scramble to provide.&nbsp; You talk and they listen. You might even feel interrogated. You leave feeling relieved it's over, and not always with the answers or support you needed going in.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help reinvigorate your board meetings, in order to build a more collaborative, supportive relationship.</p>
<p><strong>1. Send the data, share the love.</strong> Send the spreadsheets in advance (with notes and comments, if needed), but begin your presentation at the board meeting with something human. Share a letter or drawing from a kid in one of the programs whose budget you want to expand. Begin your PowerPoint with photos of people doing work in the field that the budget funded. Make a video with a staff person talking about their work and thanking the board. (Tip: It doesn't have to be a fancy video, either; you can use your phone's camera if you need to.) Connecting to the board's emotions will help them understand the human implications of the numbers and remind them why it all matters.</p>
<p><strong>2. Show and tell.</strong> Devote ten minutes in each board meeting--perhaps over lunch--to something that will help board members feel more connected to your work. Take them on a tour of a new department, walking or through slides. Ask a new employee to come and share their observations. Visit the websites of two or three peer organizations and talk about how your work relates to theirs.</p>
<p>Board members are rarely close to the work itself--which is a good thing, if you ask me--but that distance can also lead to disconnects when they make recommendations or share ideas. Bridge the divide by sharing pieces that help them feel like part of your world without inviting them to pull up a chair at your desk.</p>
<p><strong>3. Tell them what you want from them.</strong> Before each segment of the meeting, tell the board what you want from them.&nbsp; Want them to vote to approve your new name, logo, or next year's budget? Say that upfront. Sharing information for their reference only? Let them know that, too. Most board members want to help and assume, sometimes incorrectly, that asking a lot of questions or making suggestions is useful.</p>

And what the heck is a photostat?)</p>
<p>But I was also pleasantly surprised to discover how much of Vignelli's wisdom holds up in our Twitter-ified, post-typewriter age. Here are a few gems still well worth remembering:</p>
<h3>On consistency:</h3>
<p><em>Consistency and appropriateness are two yardsticks by which communications should be judged...A designer, working within guidelines established to maintain consistency, is free to focus on the most important part of design: making each communication right for its task.</em></p>
<h3>On trends:</h3>
<p><em>A recently-drawn [type]face may date quickly and should, therefore, be avoided.</em></p>
<h3>On simplicity:</h3>
<p><em>If one signal does the job, there's no need to use more.</em></p>
<p><em>Avoid clutter; it's better to show the more important things well than to cram everything in.</em></p>

<p><em>How do I get more likes/follows/insert newest social network jargon here?</em></p>","<p>It's the question that every nonprofit with a social media presence asks themselves (and us Ducks!) all the time.</p>
<p><em>How do I get more likes/follows/insert newest social network jargon here? </em></p>
<p>Well, time and time again, we've had to let people down with the bad news: there's no easy button to push that will get you a million new followers.</p>
<p>Since social media is such a low-barrier, cost-effective, and easy way to engage with your community, the thinking goes that it must be easy to boost your numbers. Right? Yet, you don't hear people talking the same way about your email list. When's the last time you expected to magically get thousands of new email addresses just by adding a sign-up form to your homepage? Everyone knows that a strong and healthy email list takes time and energy to nurture. Guess what - the same principle applies to your social media properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, there are two keys to growing your number of likes or follows: time and content. I know, I just heard you groan. Surprise! They both take work and resources.</p>
<p>Let's start with time. A surefire way to stagnant numbers is by posting a quick status update, and then ignoring your Facebook page for the rest of the week. If you can't devote at least a handful of hours each week to nurturing your community on Facebook or Twitter, it's just not going to grow. The most important thing you can do when staffing your social media team is to take a good, honest look at how many combined hours you have available each week. It might be 5, it might be 20 - heck, you might be lucky, and have a full-time staff person who can devote all 40 hours of their week.</p>
<p>Once you have that number in mind, prioritize all the work that you want to do online. If you only have 5 hours, use them as efficiently as possible - now is not the time to experiment on Google Plus or Pinterest. Instead, be laser-focused on the channel you want to grow.</p>
<p>Here's a possible breakdown for each of those five hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your analytics and Insights to see what's happening</li>
<li>Listen in to see how people are talking about your organization</li>
<li>Engage by answering questions or responding to comments</li>
<li>Create, review, or update your content calendar</li>
<li>Create content to post that week</li>
</ul>
<p>At a bare minimum, those five hours (spread out over the course of a week) can keep you above water. But the more time you can devote, the more you'll learn about your audience, and the more you can deliver the content they want.</p>
<p>What a perfect segue to the second thing to keep in mind: content! People are inherently self-serving when it comes to social media. I use Twitter to follow people who interest <strong>me</strong>, Instagram to see pictures that <strong>I</strong> like, and Facebook to keep up with those who are important to <strong>me</strong>. Notice a theme? As a brand or organization, you need to balance your desire to spread your internal messaging and talking points with creating content that I'll seek out and recognize as providing value to <strong>me</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no single right answer about what type of content to put out there (why should it be so easy?). Every organization has a different audience, and every audience wants different things. This is where taking the time to test is crucial. If you always post status updates as statements, you might not realize that your audience loves answering questions. If you use photos from your events, you could be missing out on an insatiable enthusiasm for video. The point is that you should always be testing new kinds of content to see what resonates - and even when you find that posting funny dog pictures at 9pm on Wednesdays triples your number of shares, continue to tweak based on the feedback that you receive.</p>
<p>When I see a nonprofit creating content that is unique and interesting, I'm going to click follow or like so I can get more of it. By creating value for your audience, growth will soon follow. And with enough of those clicks, pretty soon you'll be battling Justin Bieber for the most followers.<strong>*</strong></p>

<p>I started Big Duck in 1994, in the Dark Ages before ubiquitous email, internet, or iPhones. I rode my dinosaur to the office every day, where my employees and I worked diligently together. Because Big Duck began with a bricks-and-mortar office, working in the same space got baked into our culture, and a shared sense of <a href=""/about/values"" target=""_blank"">values</a> emerged. Funnily enough, I appreciate the benefits of working in an office today more than ever. Every day, Ducks are collaborating, connecting, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151300425266836&amp;set=pb.161192451835.-2207520000.1365004010&amp;type=3&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">having fun</a> in the office. That facetime makes it easier to have casual conversations, share odds and ends that make us a better team. That was underscored for me recently when a client mentioned how much she appreciated that the six or so people on our team she interacts with always all seemed to know what was going on with her project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So how does virtual working impact nonprofit organizations? More specifically, is it a good idea to have a communications staff person at your organization that works virtually? Unless you're a largely virtual or remote-working nonprofit, I'd generally advise against it. Here's why.</p>
<p>If your programs, meetings, and team are centralized in a primary location, your culture is probably centralized there, too. A communications person writing, tweeting, or Facebooking on your behalf might inadvertently become tone-deaf or miss the best content to share. They'll miss those water cooler chats and post-meeting hallway strolls where the best ideas and content often emerge, or where people share unexpected nuggets that become communications gems. They'll have to work harder to connect with a person, which makes getting content harder.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your nonprofit has offices around the world or your entire team is virtual, remote-working communicators makes sense; they are just as reflective of and embedded in your culture and internal conversations as any other staff person might be.</p>

<p>The simple but compelling idea that your nonprofit will be more successful at gaining (and keeping!) new supporters if you <strong>ask them to engage in quick and easy ways</strong> before asking them to take bigger and more meaningful actions over time.</p>","<p>Ah, the ladder of engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple but compelling idea that your nonprofit will be more successful at gaining (and keeping!) new supporters if you <strong>ask them to engage in quick and easy ways</strong> before asking them to take bigger and more meaningful actions over time.</p>
<p>But what if your mission doesn't naturally lend itself to easier, lower-rung engagement opportunities? <strong>How do keep your ladder of engagement from becoming one intimidating high bar?</strong></p>
<p>Never fear, here are some ideas and inspiration for adding compelling first steps to your ladder of engagement, no matter what your mission is.</p>
<p><strong>First rung: Get their attention, usually by getting them on your list.</strong> At least twice a year, give people an easy, quick way to take action. The trick here is to make it feel both easy <em>and</em> meaningful--either because the action has a clear impact (yup, this is where online advocacy is helpful) or a clear value, like the potential to lead to interesting information, answers, or just a heartfelt way to express your dedication.</p>
<p>In any of these options, make sure you get the most out of it by capturing a small amount of contact information from anyone who takes action, so you can stay in touch. (An email address, a ""like"" on Facebook, an address, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some examples I've found inspiring: The Smithsonian's monthly ""<a href=""http://www.smarterthanacurator.org/"" target=""_blank"">Are you as Smart as a Curator</a>?"" quiz and Fountain House's <a href=""http://fountainhouse.org/unity/signatures/thank_you"" target=""_blank"">open letter supporting young people with mental illness</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second rung: Stay in touch, become top-of-mind.</strong> Once someone is on your list, it will take a while for your organization to become familiar and top-of-mind. If you give them regular ways to see and hear from you, though, they'll be primed and ready to act when your next fundraising appeal rolls around.</p>
<p>And no, you don't have to stay in touch with a big behemoth of a monthly e-newsletter. Try shorter monthly or weekly communications via email, social media, or good old-fashioned snail mail. Just make sure your regular communication offers some way to take action again and gives content your audience will value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some inspiration: <a href=""http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5b63a0823e3b9c105434c46d7&amp;id=d5e2a3cdfe&amp;e=c144a601e0"" target=""_blank"">Daily Good's daily email</a> highlighting projects or campaigns they feel are making the world a better place. And, just 'cause I can't help but brag about my fellow Ducks, Meghan's <a href=""/nonprofit_fundraising_and_marketing_blog?author=&amp;topic=1414&amp;search_term="">Weekly Roundup</a> of nonprofit communications links on our blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third rung: Get them to go public with their support.</strong> Any time you give people a way to take action or use your resources, make sure you encourage them to follow up that action by telling their friends or going public with their support. ""Share"" links and tell-a-friend emails are great ways to do this, but we've seen plenty of innovative share graphics on Facebook, and you could consider printed shareables as well.</p>
<p>Some examples: HRC's <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151530218023281&amp;set=a.10150307206218281.358630.18813753280&amp;type=1"" target=""_blank"">use of Facebook share graphics</a> that let ""likers"" go public with their support of LGBTQ equality and the ""Challenge a friend"" prompt after the <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/actfast/Pages/know-the-signs.aspx"" target=""_blank"">NHS's ""Act FAST"" stroke awareness campaign</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth rung: Get them to make their first donation.</strong> Once someone has joined your list and taken action, getting them to give a first gift is probably your biggest benchmark of success. A welcome series of emails that ends with an appeal is a tried and true way to work new list members up to donating, but there are lots of other ways to target your most promising prospects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some creative tactics: Ask first-time donors to make a very low-level gift of a specific or symbolic amount (Like Create Jobs for USA's <a href=""http://www.createjobsforusa.org/"" target=""_blank"">""Indivisible"" wristband $5 ask</a> or the Bronx Zoo's <a href=""http://www.bronxzoo.com/roach/"" target=""_blank"">Valentine's Day Name a Roach</a> for $10 campaign. (That last one is totally worth checking out, trust us.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fifth rung: Get them to give more... or monthly!</strong> If a segment of your list has given before, they've already proven their dedication, so be sure to avoid under-asking!</p>
<p>Ask these donors for at least as much as they've previously given, or encourage them to take the next step and become monthly givers. Segmentation is your friend here--break out these donors and try some creative tactics to get them onto those highest rungs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some interesting examples: When donors gave to the Obama campaign in last year's election, they got a follow-up request to chip in a small additional amount soon after. And we've also seen several organizations try following up to recent donors a month after their gift, encouraging them to give a fraction of that amount monthly.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just to think, that's only the beginning!</p>
<p>How are you getting creative to engage supporters across different rungs of the ladder? We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!</p>

<p>Ah, summer—a perfect time for barbecues, beach umbrellas, and planning your year-end campaign. The height of fundraising season may feel like it’s a million years away, but those five months between now and December have a way of zooming by.&nbsp;</p>","<h3>Planning your annual appeal? Here’s what you need to do it right.</h3>
<p>Ah, summer—a perfect time for barbecues, beach umbrellas, and planning your year-end campaign. The height of fundraising season may feel like it’s a million years away, but those five months between now and December have a way of zooming by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help jump-start your planning, we’ve put together a few guidelines that can make any multichannel campaign—year-end or otherwise—a smashing success.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make it urgent (but keep it real).&nbsp;</strong><br />A strong campaign makes a case for why you should act&nbsp;now—not next week, next month, or next year. That means it’s important to have a deadline (like making a gift by December 31st to qualify for a match), as well as a good reason for why you need the clicks or the posts or the funds. But be careful not to cry wolf—urgency can be a double-edged sword. If every other email you send says “URGENT” in the subject line, your supporters may stop trusting you. Make sure your need is real and your ask is genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Strong design and compelling copy go hand-in-hand.</strong><br />The best stories come to life with a powerful blend of words and images. Your campaign materials should inspire and move your supporters to action, and that means great design and smart use of imagery as well as strong copy. It also means keeping the look and sound consistent across all of the different channels you use and all the different materials you produce.<br /><br /><strong>3. Don’t forget to think about next year…and the year after that…and the year after that…</strong><br />It’s easy to lose sight of the long view amidst the hustle and bustle of a time-sensitive campaign, but every message you send is part of a bigger story of how your supporters interact with your organization. You want donors and advocates to keep engaging with you year after year, and your campaign strategy should prioritize long-term relationship building as well as the short-term win. Make sure the language you use, the images you select, and the tone that you set all build off of your brand and reinforce the big idea you want people to have about your organization.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>4. It’s all about your audience.</strong><br />Think about the kinds of people who support your nonprofit. They’re probably smart (after all, they picked you). They’re also probably super busy. And they almost definitely don’t spend as much time thinking about your issue as you do. A strong campaign speaks in their language, respects their time and intelligence, and gets right to the point—while still providing enough background for them to form a real connection and know that they’re investing their time and money wisely.<br /><br /><strong>5. Stay loose.</strong><br />Campaigns are a moving target. A big news story breaks, a major donor steps up with a match, a staff person moves on to another job, and suddenly your plans need to adjust. Smart campaigners balance clear planning with enough flexibility to roll with the inevitable punches (and seize unexpected opportunities).<br /><br /><strong>6. Keep an eye on the prize.</strong><br />Campaigns should have a specific, measurable objective, whether it’s about raising money, recruiting participants, changing policies, or something else entirely. Start by defining your objective, and make sure that all of your efforts—every tweet, every email, every postcard, every call—supports your progress toward that target. And when the dust settles, step back and measure everything to see how you did, and what lessons you can learn for next time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Excited? I know we are.

<p>I’ll continue with the&nbsp;<a href=""/projects/fight_colorectal_cancer/brandraising"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>&nbsp;example from the Duck Pond. You might recall that we structured their key messages as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem: What is colorectal cancer</strong>? Colorectal cancer is cancer that forms in the rectum or colon.</li>
<li><strong>Solution: What does Fight Colorectal Cancer do?</strong>&nbsp;Fight Colorectal Cancer demands a cure for colorectal cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Action: What can you do?</strong>&nbsp;You can join the fight against colorectal cancer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of those sections, too, includes further explanation, in bullet point form.</p>
<p>If you need to create an overview brochure for Fight Colorectal Cancer, with the key messages, you’ve already got your big ideas right in front of you. And if you need to hire a freelancer who doesn’t know the first thing about the organization, the key messages serve as a good starting point.</p>
<p>The simplest way to write the content is to follow the structure of the key messages exactly. Maybe it’s one panel of the brochure for each of those sections. Turn the summarizing statements and the bullet points that follow into compelling prose that appeals to the audience you want to reach. An overview brochure is a general piece, so there will probably already be a lot of language you can pick up from the key messages. You’ll just need to write it for readability.</p>
<p>Let’s say that Fight Colorectal Cancer wants to create a brochure to get their current advocates more involved in various actions. What do you do?</p>
<p>Their current advocates probably already know the problem pretty well. Maybe you can leave the bulk of the problem section of the key messages out of your brochure copy completely. Or perhaps you have a callout with relevant facts and figures to help advocates have an easy reference point for their conversations with policymakers and friends.</p>
<p>As you look at the solution section, it kicks off with “Fight Colorectal Cancer demands a cure for colorectal cancer.” Well, that’s what advocates do, so this section is obviously relevant for your needs in writing this brochure.</p>
<p>The solution section of their messages has headings about Fight Colorectal Cancer’s patient and family support services, their aggressive approach to improving research, their role as a resource for the entire cancer community, and their advocacy work in DC. And each of those headings has backup points.</p>
<p>For an advocacy brochure, two of those sub-sections will be relevant and important: their aggressive approach to improving research and their advocacy work in DC.</p>
<p>The action section of the key messages will also be ripe with information for the advocates who’ll read your brochure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, using Fight Colorectal Cancer’s key messages, you’ll pick and choose the statements and bullet points that will be most compelling to current advocates and that will help you make a compelling case for deeper involvement. You’ll then turn those bullet points into the kind of passionate prose that appeals to activists.</p>
<p>Your key messages are meant to be fluid and adaptable. You won’t necessarily use all of them all the time. And there will almost certainly be times that you’ll need more information than just your key messages to create the prose.</p>
<p>Key messages are simply your jumping-off-point for almost any writing project, which helps you avoid that ever-daunting blank page.</p>
<p>This is just one example of key messages in action. Do you have any examples of times you’ve found key messages helpful? Any other questions about using key messages?

So to help get your new year off to a good start, we dedicated&nbsp;<a href=""/ducks-look-back-and-forward"">this month's issue of the Duck Pond</a>&nbsp;to a roundup of timely advice that we have blogged or written about this year. Think of it as a ""Year in Review"" or a ""Greatest Hits"" edition. And if that wasn’t enough for you, here’s a prediction for 2011 from each Duck for you to ponder as you look forward to the new year.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/dan-gunderman"">Dan</a>: “My pessimistic side predicts we’ll continue to see nonprofits use sector-specific jargon that no one understands. My optimistic side predicts that nonprofits will write with renewed focus on their audiences.”</li>
<li><a href=""/elizabeth-ricca"">Liz</a>: “I predict we'll see more and more nonprofits using&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code"" target=""_blank"">QR codes</a>&nbsp;to connect offline communications (like direct mail or print ads) to their online presence.”</li>
<li><a href=""/farra-trompeter"">Farra</a>: “2011 will be the year nonprofits start routinely collecting cell phone numbers and thinking about&nbsp;<a href=""/10-ways-embrace-mobile-your-nonprofit"">how to use mobile</a>. Those nonprofits that have a mobile strategy might expand it to include a mobile version of their site, a value-added smartphone app, and ways to use texting beyond fundraising.”</li>
<li><a href=""/jenna-silverman"">Jenna</a>: “With more and more nonprofits embracing social media, in 2011 we’ll see increasing numbers of nonprofits create dedicated Social Media Manager positions.”</li>
<li><a href=""/rebecca-hume"">Rebecca</a>: “Nonprofits will continue to realize the value of using infographics to demonstrate the success of their work. The Gates Foundation even has an ‘<a href=""http://www.one.org/livingproof/en/"">infographics</a>’ page.</li>
<li>Kat: “More a recommendation than a prediction, but I suggest that nonprofits get organized, plan ahead, and get their communications calendars in place early in the year.”</li>
<li><a href=""/rachel-hope-allison"">Rachel</a>: “Building up to 2012 election will push online campaigners to come up with new ways to mobilize people online (my bet is even more uses of Facebook Connect). And a tip: Subscribe to candidates' email lists early, and let their ideas inspire leaps in your own online outreach!”</li>
<li>Indra: “The&nbsp;<a href=""/annual-report-dead-long-live-annual-report"">shift away from traditional print annual reports</a>&nbsp;will continue with more being designed as mini-websites.&nbsp;<a href=""http://salvationarmyannualreport.org/"">The Salvation Army</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/annual-report"">the New York Public Library</a>&nbsp;already do this nicely.”</li>
<li><a href=""/sarah-durham"">Sarah</a>: “In 2011, nonprofits will embrace communications as a way to build relationships with donors, clients, and other key audiences more fully by staffing differently for it. Instead of having development staff or no staff at all managing communications, we'll see more organizations hiring dedicated staff people to manage their brand, leverage social media for social change, and make sure their organization is staying current.”</li>
<li><a href=""/madeleine-milan"">Maddy</a>: “Nonprofits will focus more and more on communicating their impact, not just their activities.”</li>
<li><a href=""/scott-moe"">Scott</a>: “In the upcoming year, I think nonprofits will trim their social media down and focus mainly on Facebook and Twitter, as those become the two most universally accepted tools. I also envision a brighter web future for nonprofits, in which very clean, open, and uncluttered websites rule the day.”</li>
<li>Sonny: “Nonprofits will be more adventurous about themselves and their work. With budgets running low, and competition to stand out from peers and stay worthy of your audience's attention running high, anything that demonstrates a true personality or breaks some molds will win the day. Whether it's an unexpected rebrand, a campaign with humor, or a new app, nonprofit organizations will take that leap.”</li>

(Trust me, I should know.)</p>","<p>Everybody makes mistakes, sure, but nothing kills good writing like a their that should have been a they’re or a misspelled word. (Trust me, I should know.)</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that nothing detracts more from the professionalism and power of our words than a careless mistake.</p>
<p>The good news: with a little extra care, those kinds of careless mistakes are easy to spot and/or avoid.</p>
<p>The bad news: In the hustle and bustle of life at any nonprofit, it can be tricky to carve out that extra time for a thorough proofread. But trust me, nonprofiteers, it’s really, really worth it.</p>
<p>This is actually something I think about a lot as a writer. As you can imagine, mistakes have their way of popping up in the stuff I write from time to time. Sigh. And I’ve been trying to deepen my ability to proofread, which, after all, is a highly specific skill not really synonymous with writing or editing.</p>
<p>I recently attended a quick crash course in proofreading at the <a href=""http://brooklynbrainery.com/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Brainery</a>—which hosts cheap classes on everything from comedy and design to book-binding and Australian desserts and is really worth checking out—where I was reminded that you don’t have to be a professional proofreader to improve whatever process you have in place.</p>
<p>During the 90-minute session, I learned a ton of great tips. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many nonprofit communicators—and many people in different professions, for that matter—wear many hats, of which a writing hat, an editing hat, and a proofreading hat are only a mere few. The trick is to put them on one by one. Writing a first draft? Don’t bother searching just yet for spelling and punctuation mistakes. There’s a time and a place for putting on your proofreading hat—at the end of the writing and editing process.</li>
<li>There are proven techniques that really work. Read your writing aloud—or even backwards. I struggled with this during the class, but it works.</li>
<li>If it feels tedious, good. It should. Keep going. Read it again. And again.</li>
<li>If you’re prone to making certain mistakes, rather than being overly hard on yourself, make a list of them, along with names, abbreviations, acronyms, or vocabulary specific to your field. Keep it close by as you write, and make it a part of your own personal proofreading process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have any great proofreading tips of your own? Share them in the comments—and don’t judge me if any mistakes slipped through the crack and ended up in this blog post.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1409%1","Big Duck Blog | How to error-proof your writing","","","","copywriting proofreading ","copywriting ","<p><span>Photo by withassociates (Flickr)</span></p>",

It only takes a minute to spin up a new Page or Group, which sounds like a great way to keep your different audiences in neat segments: one space for recruits and one for alums; one for donors and one for advocates; one for event participants and one for year-round supporters. Segmenting makes a lot of sense in emails and direct mail and elsewhere in your communications world, so why not Facebook?</p>","<p>As a nonprofit, it's easy to spread yourself too thin on Facebook. It only takes a minute to spin up a new Page or Group, which sounds like a great way to keep your different audiences in neat segments: one space for recruits and one for alums; one for donors and one for advocates; one for event participants and one for year-round supporters. Segmenting makes a lot of sense in emails and direct mail and elsewhere in your communications world, so why not Facebook?</p>
<p>The issues tend to arise when it comes time to feed and care for all of those different spaces you've created. Social networks take time and attention in order to thrive, and the more outposts you have, the more time it takes—it doesn't necessarily get a lot faster or easier as you scale up. So if you're like most nonprofiteers I've talked to about this issue, you'll eventually find yourself copying and pasting the same status update three or four different times, just to make sure it reaches all of your people (who, by the way, are probably a little confused as to where exactly they're supposed to go).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you're thinking about the wisdom of creating a separate Facebook presence for a specific group or event, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you (and should you) provide content with unique value to this audience (separate from the rest of the people you're talking to)—stuff that only they would care about?</li>
<li>If so, will that unique content be distracting or off-putting to your other audiences?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can answer ""yes"" to both questions, you probably have a good reason for segmenting your efforts and making a separate Page or Group. For example, you might need to keep administrative info for your volunteer event coordinators (""Don't forget—we're meeting at 9 a.m. tomorrow"") separate from your main Facebook Page. (Of course, there's also a question as to whether that information needs to be shared on Facebook at all—a topic for another day.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you can't answer ""yes,"" you might just want to keep it one big party on your primary Page and avoid spinning off smaller Facebook communities. It keeps things simpler—and sometimes, giving your different audience groups a way to interact with each other can pay off. Hearing about that alumni happy hour might lead a prospective parent to appreciate the warmth of your community, and a current participant raving about how awesome their experience is might inspire others to register.</p>

Whether you do it yourself or work with professionals, finding those few perfect words that explain, reinforce, or balance an organization’s name… Well, it’s just hard.</p>","<p>Creating a great tagline for your organization is no small feat. Whether you do it yourself or work with professionals, finding those few perfect words that explain, reinforce, or balance an organization’s name… Well, it’s just hard.</p>
<p>We were recently reviewing some of the taglines we’ve written for nonprofits over the years. There are some we’re particularly proud of, like “Equal play” for the <a href=""http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Sports Foundation</a>, “Get behind the cure” for <a href=""http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/"" target=""_blank"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>, or “Community by the cabinful” for the <a href=""http://www.jewishcamp.org/"" target=""_blank"">Foundation for Jewish Camp</a>. Great taglines seem to have a little something special. They get you to think. They evoke real emotion. They inspire action.</p>
<p>So we asked ourselves: What do all of the great taglines have in common? The answer surprised even us.</p>
<p>All of the taglines we do distill an organization’s positioning down, incorporating some of the personality for artistry, to as few words as possible. Likewise, most of them accomplish one of three things (and we’ll use some examples from organizations we haven’t worked with to demonstrate what we mean):</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Explain what the organization does</b>. NRDC uses “The Earth’s Best Defense.” It says in four easy words that they defend the earth. Answering the “what” of your organization is a great option if your name doesn’t say much about you.</li>
<li><b>Express why the organization does its work</b>. UNCF adopted “A mind is a terrible thing to waste” in 1972. It’s a classic. And it still works. Note that it says nothing at all about what they do. It doesn’t matter. It gets you to think and feel. “Why?” can be a powerful question to answer.</li>
<li><b>Inspire an audience to take action</b>. New York Foundling uses “Abandon no one” as a great call-to-action. Simple. Effective. Affecting. Nike’s “Just do it” is the quintessential for-profit example.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you create a tagline that distills down your positioning, feels like your personality, and does at least one of these three things, you’ll be well on your way to a successful tagline.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t quite answer why some of them are great and others just work. So, then, what is it? What’s the secret sauce? The answer is in two parts.</p>
<p>The first part is that these great taglines have represented some form of risk for the client. Maybe they’ve been a serious departure from how the organization communicated before. Maybe it’s aspirational enough that the organization isn’t sure they can live up to it. Maybe the tone is just bolder than makes them comfortable.</p>
<p>The second part of the answer is that a great tagline also takes a <i>champion</i>.</p>
<p>Without a champion, these taglines would never have seen the light of day. (Some beloved taglines don’t make it out of committee, which is the nature of the process.) Each of our favorites had someone at our client’s organization that took what we’d developed together and shepherded it through all of the various hurdles it may have faced along the path toward approval.</p>
<p>And how these great taglines have been shepherded through the process varies a great deal as well, depending on the organization and its culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the champion is a key decision maker (such as a President or Executive Director) and they love the tagline enough, they might just make a unilateral decision, completely undemocratically.</li>
<li>If the champion doesn’t have the ultimate decision-making power, they might have private conversations with key individuals, winning over the right people at the right times.</li>
<li>If the champion has a forceful enough personality—whether they’re the ultimate decision maker or someone who needs to get buy-in—they’ll just keep arguing in favor of the tagline they love until everyone is convinced or until everyone gets tired of arguing with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, champions have asked for our help getting taglines through the process, and sometimes they haven’t. But either way, we love our champions. And here are a few more of the taglines we love best, in case you’re looking for inspiration. There is a great champion behind each of these taglines (and, of course, there are some great champions not represented here as well):</p>
<ul>
<li>Auburn: Trouble the waters. Heal the world.</li>
<li>Brooklyn Community Foundation: Do good right here.</li>
<li>New York City Charter School Center: It’s about great public schools.</li>
<li>New York Peace Institute: Let us get in the middle.</li>

<p>They’re the nonprofit world’s version of celebrities, the organizations who have managed to have a multichannel campaign go “viral.”</p>
<p><b>The bad news about these guys?</b> There IS a certain amount of luck and timing pixie dusk that goes into hitting the viral heights.</p>
<p><b>But the good news far outweighs the bad</b>, and that’s that, viral pixie dust aside, much of what made these blockbuster campaigns successful is achievable for almost any organization. Namely – <b>before their campaigns went viral, they each took small, simple steps to build a strong foundation of trust and excitement among their core supporters.</b></p>
<p>And if you do the same, chances are you can raise powerful amounts of awareness and funds – even without going viral.</p>
<p><b>So how can you build your own powerful foundation for multichannel success?</b> Start by scanning this checklist for your core supporters, and taking some of the small, but absolutely doable steps that can take you to the next level of multichannel stardom.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, does my audience…</p>
<h3>1. Actually exist… and is it reachable?</h3>
<p>Chances are, you already have supporters who are excited about your work. But can you reach them? Make sure existing supporters can stay in touch with you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for a minimal, initial form of contact information (like an email or mailing address) wherever supporters who aren’t yet on your list engage with you (like on your website or at events).</li>
<li>Once they’re reachable in one channel, make it easy for them to hear from you in other channels as well. This can be as easy as adding an email form field to your direct mail reply device, or asking email subscribers to like you on Facebook.</li>
<li>While simply asking for contact information is better than nothing, it’s even more effective to do so alongside an action that relates to your mission, like an online petition, survey, or advocacy action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Do they know who the heck we are?</h3>
<p>Once a new supporter joins your list, don’t assume they know your organization well. Help get to know your work and your team by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure you have clear, visible explanations of your mission on your website.</li>
<li>Establishing one or two regular signers on your email and mail communications, and making sure they write with consistent personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Paying special attention to new list members by sending them special welcome messages and thank-you messages after they take action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Do they expect and want to hear from us?</h3>
<p>Stay out of sight and you’ll stay out of mind—stay on your audience’s radar by sending messages and updates on a regular basis…</p>
<ul>
<li>In email, send at least one email a month (do less and your response rates will fall)</li>
<li>In social media, shoot for one to two social media updates a week, and try to end each one by asking for your followers to like, share, or comment</li>
<li>In mail, send at least two direct mail packages a year—and make sure at least one hits mailboxes in December for that all-important year-end season.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Do they see us in the channels that are right for them?</h3>
<p>Start investing in the channels where your audience is already active by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Researching your supporters preferences and habits—try launching a quick online survey or poll that asks them how they like to hear from you.</li>
<li>Setting up pages or systems in the channels your audience indicates, and gradually building up your list in each by sending regular updates (see #3)</li>
<li>Helping your audiences explore new channels by regularly cross-promoting other ways to stay in touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Do they know why their support is needed, and why it matters?</h3>
<p>Establish the need for support by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the problem or opportunity the supporter will be helping to solve or seize by taking action. Make this as specific and tangible as possible.</li>
<li>After you explain the specific problem, show why donating or acting now also relates back to your big picture mission</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Do they trust that we’re legit?</h3>
<p>Establish credibility with your audience by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying prominent trust seals on donation pages and forms</li>
<li>Making sure all fundraising appeals and forms use a design that displays your logo prominently, and feels consistent with your website and brand.</li>
<li>Sending prompt receipts and thank you’s after someone has made a donation, and somewhat later, following up with an update on the impact of their giving.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Do they know how they can (Quickly! Easily!) make a difference?</h3>
<p>Even when the need has been established, your audience needs your help to understand how they can make a difference. Make it clear by …</p>
<ul>
<li>Even when you’re trying to keep your audience informed, try to also make it interactive by ending with a clear request to do something to help—either by sharing the news, taking action, or donating.</li>
<li>Make it easy to take action with simple, focused forms or reply devices.</li>
<li>Once they have taken action, always remind them there are other ways to stay involved via other channels or supporting actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Has our audience gotten big enough to invest more resources in outreach?</h3>
<p>As you’re establishing your multichannel foundation with the above steps, be strategic about how and where you’ll try to expand your multichannel outreach by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Researching the start-up cost of establishing new channels or offerings, a great resource is the <a href=""http://www.nten.org/"" target=""_blank"">NTEN.org</a> community</li>
<li>Looking to industry benchmarks to gauge the initial returns you can expect</li>
<li>Exploring how much outside consulting or internal staffing time you’ll need to make the most of an expanded multichannel program</li>

<p>During my time at Big Duck, I’ve been truly inspired by the nonprofiteers I’ve met, all people who, as we Ducks like to say, give a quack about the causes that matter most to them, and who want to make a difference. And I wanted to create a new, fun way for all of you to share your vision and talk about what inspires you and drives the amazing work you’re doing.</p>
<p>So before I move on from this smart, fun, and creative place at the end of the week to embark on a new adventure, let me introduce you to #DuckSnaps.</p>

<p>If I had a nickle for every time I’ve been asked that question… but it’s a good one none the less. As I’ve considered ways to answer it usefully, there are a few exercises I’ve discovered really do help people within nonprofit organizations get more aligned about their communications.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is this simple Materials Review exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Schedule a one hour meeting with your leadership team</b> in a room with a big table and good lighting.&nbsp; Don’t share the agenda- just say you’re going to review your communications.</li>
<li><b>Gather a year’s worth of your communications.</b> That means event invites, print outs from your website and social media, your newsletter- whatever the outside world has received from you, or your chapters, programs, etc.</li>
<li><b>Lay it all out on the table.</b> When your leadership team arrives, let your materials speak for themselves. Encourage them to stay standing, walk around, pick things up, and talk about it all. Then facililate a discussion using the following questions, or adapt your own.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Questions for discussion:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If a donor, client, lawmaker (etc), saw most of these materials, what impression of our organization would they leave?</li>
<li>Do our materials support a clear understanding of who we are?</li>
<li>Do our materials reflect our personality- the tone and style we want to communicate- well?</li>
<li>What, if anything, should we change in order to communicate more effectively?</li>
<li>What, if anything, should our next steps be?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other ways to spark useful conversations around branding and communciations too. Some folks tell me that taking our <a href=""/free_nonprofit_marketing_resource"" target=""_blank"">brandraising scorecard</a>&nbsp;self-assesssment tool and sharing responses internally has been useful, for instance.</p>
<p>I’ll be giving a free webinar <a href=""/big-duck-webinar-brandraising"" target=""_blank"">about brandraising next Tuesday, June 18</a>.&nbsp;Join me to talk about exercises like this, learn more about what brandraising is, and more.</p>

Something we could all do with remembering more often.”</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure whether I agree that choosing what not to do is the true essence of strategy (I could debate geekily for hours about what the true essence of strategy is), but I do agree that choosing what not to do is essential to solid strategy.</p>
<p>With all things nonprofit communications (and beyond), the more things you choose to do, the less effective you end up being.</p>
<p>A few examples...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/01/why_you_need_a_better_elevator.html"" target=""_blank"">When you try to explain absolutely everything your organization does the first time someone asks about it</a>, and she walks away from the conversation more confused than when she first asked (or worse, wishing she hadn’t asked).</li>
<li>Trying to find a tagline that says everything about your organization (rather than just the most important bits, like your <a href=""/free_nonprofit_marketing_resource_glossary#Objectives"" target=""_blank"">positioning</a> and <a href=""/free_nonprofit_marketing_resource_glossary#Personality"" target=""_blank"">personality</a>), and ending up with something long, confusing, and forgettable.</li>
<li>Using your donation form to show donors every possible way to give to your organization, and as a result <a href=""http://www.futurefundraisingnow.com/future-fundraising/2013/05/how-to-make-your-landing-page-a-place-that-welcomes-people.html"" target=""_blank"">overwhelming and scaring off a significant number of potential donors</a>.</li>
<li>The more social media channels you get involved in, the less time you have to dedicate to the ones that really matter.</li>
<li><a href=""http://communitymediaworkshop.org/npcommunicator/the-general-public-is-not-your-audience/"" target=""_blank"">The more audiences you try to reach</a>, the less success you have in reaching and engaging the ones that really matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritizing what’s the single most important goal, audience, action, channel, story, or message for your communications (or, put another way, deciding what isn’t the most important) is one of the most effective ways your can make your nonprofit’s communications more effective. It’s not easy. But it is essential.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1408%2,1407%3","Big Duck Blog | Choosing what not to do","","","Choosing-what-not-to-do","Brandraising audiences positioning personality elevator-pitch","Brandraising audiences positioning personality elevator-pitch","",

<p>For a first-class favicon, it’s important to think creatively. A logo that works well at an inch or two may not translate to a 16-by-16-pixel grid. If yours is looking more smudgy than shapely, try focusing instead on a single element of your brand identity—maybe just a distinctive letter or shape.</p>

(Don't tell the other Ducks—I might get voted out.) So I rarely eat candy—but if I'm on the road between meals and my options are limited, I sometimes buy a Snickers bar.</p>
<p>I tell myself it's because I find them filling—peanuts are protein, right?—and I kind of enjoy them, but really it probably has a lot to do with commercials like this one.</p>
<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0DxlOWVVQWE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></p>
<p>I love how smart this commercial is. It's not selling me a candy bar—it's selling me a solution to a problem: when I'm hungry, I don't think or act the way I usually do (my friend calls it ""being hangry,"" which certainly is apt in my case).</p>
<p>Snickers is a convenient, easy solution to that problem, available on pretty much any street corner or at any gas station. They've spent years building up the impression that their candy bars are filling and hearty—think ""Snickers really satisfies."" and ""Hungry? Why wait? Grab a Snickers."" And that means that when I get a Snickers bar, I'm purchasing candy—but what I'm really buying is a feeling of satisfaction.</p>
<p>There's a big idea here that I think is especially relevant for nonprofits: thinking beyond the transaction. When someone makes a donation to your organization, or signs up to volunteer, or registers to run a race, what are they <em>really</em> getting? Is it the glow of doing good? The pride of being part of something exciting? The warmth of being part of a community? The personal satisfaction of setting and meeting a challenge?</p>
<p>Nonprofits don't always think about it this way, but you have something real to offer your supporters, even if it's intangible—and your communications and fundraising materials should reflect that.</p>
<p>So grab a few colleagues and brainstorm about what those intangible benefits are for your organization, then take another look at your latest campaign email or fundraising letter or brochure. You might just see some new opportunities to give your supporters what they're really looking for.</p>

<p>Once an organization’s been around for a few years, changing something as central as a name gets complicated.

<ol>
<li><strong>Start with a clear strategy.</strong> In the <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"">Brandraising model</a>, positioning and personality are the drivers behind everything. A good name should support the big idea you want people to associate with you (that’s your positioning), and have the right tone and style (that’s your personality). Even if you don’t subscribe to our model, start with some basic strategy everyone agrees on so you can avoid subjective decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the options.</strong> By looking at your peers or beyond, you’ll notice that there are lots of types of names: short, long, conjoined, etc. What structures are the most logical, practical, and appropriate for you?</li>
<li><strong>Use your values.</strong> Consider the name options through the lens of your organization’s values (which are often the formal expression of your culture). You’ll want a name that feels authentic when you hang it on the front door.</li>
<li><strong>Check your IP.</strong> Names are “intellectual property” and can be trademarked. Unfortunately, many of the most obvious choices might be taken already (especially if you’re hoping for a simple, one-word name). We prefer to search any names under consideration informally before they are presented. Downstream, vet your short list of options using an attorney with intellectual property experience.</li>
<li><strong>Think about the handles.</strong> How will the name adapt to a URL? Twitter handle? Email addresses?</li>

A lot of tips come to mind, but ultimately, it’s about simply writing well.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there aren’t certain medium-specific practices to consider as you write a website or an email (mostly because of how different the experience of online reading is from offline reading), <a href=""/who_writes_well_online"">as some of my coworkers would be more than happy to discuss with you</a>.</p>
<p>Nor is it to minimize the role of design in our experience of the words on the screen.</p>
<p>But nothing, not even the craziest scrolling or the next big internet thing to come or the snazziest of designs, can magically make bad writing good.</p>
<p>I recently stumbled upon <a href=""http://justinjackson.ca/words.html"">this web-page piece by Justin Jackson</a>, a great reminder of the value of simplicity in the era of things like parallax scrolling and responsive design. While I (and plenty of other Ducks) appreciate and are fascinated by these new breakthroughs in approaches to web design, it’s important to always remember the power of words, especially as we continue to move far beyond the basic HTML in which Jackson dresses his particular choice of words.</p>
<p>So, can innovative design enhance good writing? Sure.

Of the 75 or so people who attended, many of them worked in organizations with no full-time communications staff, and they were hungry to learn ways to do more with less.</p>
<p>A participant who’s thinking of starting a nonprofit asked me a great question: “If my programs are geared for younger people, how can I communicate with them on their terms without putting off older people who might be supporters?”</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering about this issue for a while, and keeping my eyes open for examples of nonprofits that are able to communicate in a way that makes their audiences of all ages feel at home.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you look for them, examples of ‘one size fits all ages’ communications abound.&nbsp;One of my favorite examples is from our client, Hillel. Their program, <a href=""/hillel-campus-community-engagement"">Ask Big Questions</a>, sparks meaningful conversations on college campuses and has been celebrated and supported by older crowds too. Its language and design is fresh and clear (if I do say so myself), which has universal appeal.</p>
<p>Look around. You’ll find the nonprofit sector abounds with great examples of communications that resonate for audiences of all ages. The trick is to avoid language that’s insidery or alienating, like jargon or acronyms, and design that’s dull or confusing. No matter their age, most people won’t respond particularly well to either.</p>

This ebook features insights from 19 nonprofit staff members and consultants sharing their smarts in the areas of email marketing, online fundraising, social media, mobile engagement, peer-to-peer fundraising, and multichannel campaigns. If you haven’t already given it a read, take some time this summer to scroll through it, especially with <a href=""/12-steps-to-make-your-year-end-fundraising-campaign-stand-out-august-14"">year-end fundraising season right around the corner</a>.&nbsp;And fear not, my old-school friends, you can also download and print it.</p>
<p>My article in the ebook focused on the cornerstone of any good online fundraising or multichannel campaign: email. Easily dismissed by some due to declining open rates or the appeal of newer channels such as Instagram or Tumblr, <a href=""http://www.nonprofithub.org/featured/nonprofit-online-fundraising-infographic/%20"" target=""_blank"">email is still the biggest source of dollars raised online</a>. To help nonprofiteers better use email to build relationships with supporters, I shared some tips in a webinar this week, which you can watch in the video here:</p>
<p><iframe width=""500"" height=""375"" src=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/69164845"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen="""" mozallowfullscreen="""" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></p>
<p>In this webinar (and the article in the ebook), I suggest a four-step approach to improving donor communications through email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect emails and build your list.</li>
<li>Connect with supporters through a welcome series.</li>
<li>Coordinate communication across the organization and diversify<br />asks/calls to action.</li>
<li>Report back on results and say thank you.</li>
</ol>
<p>I included some specific examples from nonprofits as well as helpful data to back up the important role email can play in engaging and keeping donors. During the discussion, I also addressed some questions regarding email deliverability, frequency, and the interplay between advocacy, social media, and fundraising. Watch it and let me know what you think or other questions you have.</p>

Since then, the organization has experienced rapid growth on all levels, and has emerged as the leader in their space. Working with the National Brain Tumor Society hits home for me personally: I lost both of my parents to brain tumors. So, in addition to the work we did together, I began to volunteer personally for the organization. In 2012, I joined their board.&nbsp; Earlier this year, I attended a board meeting in the organization’s new offices in Newton, MA. I was immediately impressed by how the new office reflected the organization’s personality on many levels, so I asked Kristina Knight, their Chief Marketing and Community Relations Officer, to tell me more about how they did it.</p>
<p><strong>How did you integrate the National Brain Tumor Society's personality, positioning, and identity into your new office space?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kris:</strong> We were fortunate to move into a location that was being completely overhauled, allowing us to design our new office from scratch. We wanted the space to be open, collaborative, empowering, cerebral, adaptable, and super functional. These traits are also core to how we operate as an organization, relate with our constituents, and direct our efforts through our integrated programs. The office space is also surrounded on three sides by huge windows, helping to reinforce a positive and hopeful atmosphere, which is critical to the work we do in the world of brain tumors.</p>
<p>In additional to the use of the space, we incorporated our three brand colors strategically in the office. When you first enter, we set up a gallery. We used our orange to reflect our energy and that we are fiercely committed to finding a cure and changing the way things are done. We also incorporated our mission statement* and images that reflect our breadth so anyone who comes into the space is immediately drawn in and feels who we are.</p>
<p>Our blue color is more neutral and calming, so was used to connect the split-level in the office and wrap into the kitchen, a primary gathering spot for staff. Finally, our green was applied to the far wall in the program area and clear <a href=""http://www.ideapaint.com"">Idea Paint</a>&nbsp;was applied floor-to-ceiling over it (converting it into a giant writeable surface). We use it as an active collaboration space for exploring and growing ideas and concepts, sometimes on an hourly basis! We also incorporated white Idea Paint walls throughout the office, meeting rooms and conference rooms to help us actively engage with the space and one another. Throughout the office we enlarged our best photography, showcasing the people participating in our Walk, Race, and Ride events, research workshops, and advocacy efforts to constantly remind us of the community we serve.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/5ef60d32b6307bf34daea7edb9da5326/files/nbts_main_02.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""332"" /></p>

<p>It is incredibly satisfying to work every day in a space that seamlessly reflects who we are. It reinforces our core values in subtle and obvious ways, literally making us all ‘live’ the brand while we work.</p>
<p><b>Got any advice for nonprofits that want to bring their brands to life in their spaces too?</b><b></b></p>
<p><strong>Kris:</strong> First thing I would say is don’t over do it.</p>
<p>If you bring your identity colors in, for instance, pick one way you want to apply them. Make it simple. Don’t get so excited you paint every wall a color or decorate the entire office in multi-color objects. Pick one thing, maybe desk lamps or event posters. Or maybe take a handful of the words that describe the organization and incorporate them in key spots in the office (lobby, meeting rooms, kitchen).</p>
<p>I also really like bringing the community into the space. Many folks hunkered down in the office don’t get out to interact a lot so it is important to put faces to the cause. It’s powerful to have the reminder of why we do what we do everyday.</p>
<p><i>* Mission statement: </i><i>National Brain Tumor Society is fiercely committed to finding better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for people living with a brain tumor today and anyone who will be diagnosed tomorrow. This means effecting change in the system at all levels. It’s time to build on progress and transform tomorrow, today.</i><i></i></p>

<p>Segmenting your list is common practice in the direct mail world: you'd never send your standard acquisition package to a major donor (at least, not knowingly). But when it comes to email, a lot of nonprofits take a one-size-fits-all approach—and that means they're missing out on some important opportunities.</p>
<p>Never tried segmenting your email list before? It can be pretty simple when you break it down: it's just a matter of dividing your list into a few different sub-groups, and sending something different to each group.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">So where do I start?</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of simple ways you might segment your list for your year-end appeal messages:</p>
<p><strong>Tailor your ask to previous gift size</strong>.</p>
<p>Split your list up into just a couple of different groups—say, for example, those who've given you $500 or more, those who've given you $200-499, and those who've given less than $200 (or haven't given yet). Send each group the exact same message—but when they click through to the donation page, show each group a different gift string. The $500+ group might start at $500 and go up from there, the $200+ group at $200, and the rest get your standard string.</p>
<p>If you want to get extra fancy (and your CRM/donation processing system permits it), you might be able to make the gift string completely customized to the donor's giving history (i.e., the page would display different amounts to each donor, based on the largest or most recent gift you have recorded from that person).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Show your monthly donors a little extra love</strong>.</p>
<p>Split your monthly donors out from your normal list, and send them a special version of your general email appeal. Acknowledge that they've committed to support you in an ongoing way, and express your appreciation—and tell them that you're hoping they'll give you an additional gift this year-end. If possible, give them an urgent reason why they should increase their support for you.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be fancy—it could be the same message you send to everyone else with just a couple of copy tweaks. But by paying a little extra attention to your regular donors and the special relationship they have with you, you might increase their chances of making another gift. For inspiration,<a href=""http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=4109fdd323aaac7078eadaa8f&amp;id=c823523ab0&amp;e=6e1a8cd75b"" target=""_blank""> here's a nice example of a special message that WNYC sent to monthly donors</a> at the start of their spring pledge drive.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge donors who've already given</strong>.</p>
<p>If you send out multiple appeals over the course of the year-end season, there will be some eager supporters who'll give the very first time you ask them (love those guys!). You don't necessarily want to suppress them from the rest of your campaign messages—they're your most enthusiastic supporters, after all, and maybe they'll even give again as they see how the campaign plays out.</p>
<p>Consider capitalizing on their enthusiasm by sending them a modified version of your next message. You might add a special note to them at the top, thanking them for their prompt gift and encouraging them to take another action (forward the message to friends, perhaps, or promote the campaign on Facebook).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Cool. I'll definitely come back to this when we're ready to send emails in November.</h3>
<p>Don't hit the snooze button just yet! If you're going to experiment with segmentation, there are a few things you should do now, before the madness of year-end hits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find out what your system can do</strong>. Most donor management/email systems have some features built in that support segmentation—like customizing a donation string. Spend a few hours poking around in the features overview page, or calling up a customer support representative to find out what's available to you.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you know what kind of data you have</strong>. Before you know what kind of segmentation is realistic, you'll need to know what you're working with (and make time for a little cleanup, if it's needed).&nbsp;Are the records in your database sourced (i.e., do you know whether they came from an event or a webpage or something else)? Is your donation tracking system clean and up-to-date, so that there's a good chance your donor records are accurate (at least in terms of their online giving activity)? What kinds of reports and lists are you able to pull?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Practice pulling your segmented lists, and write down all the steps involved</strong>. You'll thank yourself in December when there isn't a lot of time for learning new technology.</li>
</ul>

Here are a few ways you can leverage these quieter days of summer to help make the most of the year-end giving season downstream and avoid last-minute glitches.</p>
<p><strong>Test your donation landing pages and thank you’s.</strong> <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/The-Big-Boom-in-Online-Giving/139965?cid=megamenu"" target=""_blank"">A recent study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy</a> reported a 14% rise in online donations last year. When was the last time you made a gift to your organization online and experienced yourself from your donor’s point of view? If it’s been awhile, now’s the time to make sure your online donation processing system, thank you forms, and automated responses are all written well and functioning correctly so you’ve got time to fix any glitches. <a href=""/wanna-raise-money-online-don%E2%80%99t-forget-about-email"">It’s also a great time to review how your nonprofit uses email to raise money</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Review your presence on <a href=""http://www.charitynavigator.org/"" target=""_blank"">Charity Navigator</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/us/Wise-Giving/"" target=""_blank"">Wise Giving Alliance</a>, <a href=""http://www.guidestar.org/"" target=""_blank"">Guidestar</a>, and other sites your most savvy donors might visit.</strong> Is your information all up-to-date and accurate? Sophisticated donors may use these independent evaluators to help them decide if they’ll respond to your appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Review your website analytics.</strong> We hope you’re reviewing them regularly, but if you’re not, mid-year is a good time to look at your site’s traffic, most visited pages, and conversion metrics. What pages are most visited? Do they need updating or are they in good shape? What pages are visitors most likely to enter through or leave from? Reviewing your analytics can help you determine if areas of your site need touch-ups or overhauls before more donors visit.</p>
<p><strong>Test for mobile giving on phones and tablets.</strong> <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/Ideas-BigSmall-Make/139921/"" target=""_blank"">19% of the money that the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute raised online last year was donated via a mobile source</a>. When donors visit your website on their smart phone or tablet, what will they see? How easy will it be for them to make a gift? If you’re not ready to redesign your site to be responsive for mobile devices, consider budgeting for this change downstream and redesigning a few key pages donors are most likely to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Practice good list hygiene.</strong> Is your database in good shape? If not, now’s a good time to merge/purge, update info, or consider appending to get more emails (with permission, of course).</p>
<p><strong>Build your list now.</strong> The summer and fall can be great times to engage your supporters and find new ones with actions that are not fundraising-related. From asking questions on social media to sending messages to representatives, connect with your community and grow your base.</p>
<p><strong>Start planning this year’s campaign now.</strong> Testing a new appeal? Thinking about using new channels or tools? Now’s a good time to start planning so you’ve got time to set up or adjust your accounts, and to do your best work before the fall fundraising season hits.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href=""/nonprofit_training"">workshops and webinars</a> we’ve got coming up to help you jumpstart that process.

It rarely stands alone, but successful design should help tell an audience a bit more about the organization, or better yet, let them have an experience. Does your design echo your personality? More importantly, does it make the audience feel anything? If it doesn't, it probably should.</p>
<p>My inspiration for this kind of work strays well outside of the nonprofit world and catches me wherever I find it, in this case, in the very strange but amazing artwork of Stones Throw Records.</p>
<p>It's often pretty weird music, and as such, it demands artwork that's equally colorful. Enter Jeff Jank, Stones Throw's art director. His work spans a huge range of styles, dutifully capturing the flavor of the music it represents. Whether it's heart-shaped vinyl for a throwback soul singer, or the cartoon rendering of an imaginary rapper, altogether it's some of my favorite design living out in the world today.</p>

But how do you do it? Here’s a handy list of twelve steps for campaigns.</p>","<p>By now, you’ve probably heard that taking a multichannel approach to your fundraising, list-building, advocacy, or outreach campaign is the only way to go. But how do you do it? Here’s a handy list of twelve steps for campaigns.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1. Find a subject that’s relevant and timely to your audience.</h3>
<p>What's happening in the world as it relates to your mission? Any holidays or other major events on the horizon? Look for ways to hook your work into news that your donors and wider community may have heard about.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. Identify your organization’s most urgent objectives for this year.</h3>
<p>What are your current approaches to accomplish your mission? What are the real needs or problems your organization is facing that your campaign can address? It can help your community relate to your work if you can establish the need for their support. Even better if you can frame your work as the solution to the problem you are addressing.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3. Build a common campaign story across channels.</h3>
<p>The five key elements to a strong campaign story are: problem, solution, action, goal, and timeline. More than just explaining what the problem is and how you'll solve it, determine a goal for what you want to accomplish so that supporters can feel like their actions are having an impact on the solution during the time of the campaign (be it over one month or several years).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">4. Decide on a concept to unify the look and feel of all elements.</h3>
<p>Once you’ve got the story done, be sure to connect the dots in how you execute the campaign with a compelling name, unified visual look (font, photos, etc.), and message (copy lines, emotional triggers, and ‘brand personality’).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">5. Select the right channels to reach your audiences.</h3>
<p>Take a moment to pause and think like one of your donors. Now think about where they go to get information about the issues you are working on. Do they open every email? 'Like' every Facebook status update? Retweet actions on Twitter? Visit your website every week to see what's new?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">6. Maximize each channel for what it does best.</h3>
<p>A good campaign doesn’t just appear across multiple communications channels, (including email, direct mail, social media, website, video, and phone), but coordinates how these channels reinforce one another. Even better when you use each channel for what works best in how your community uses it, such as thanking donors on Facebook or asking activists to respond to an immediate deadline over email.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">7. Include an action other than giving.</h3>
<p>We’re pretty fundraising-focused around here and assume that you are, too. If your campaign is trying to raise money, great, but be sure you don’t treat your donor like an endless ATM. Invite them to take other actions — like contacting a representative, signing a petition, or responding to a quiz — before you ask them to donate. Oh, and please limit the action in each element to one simple and direct call to action.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">8. Set the right goal to motivate your audiences.</h3>
<p>Remember that overall goal you set for the campaign as part of step three? Make sure it feels inspirational – so supporters are motivated to be part of it — and somewhat achievable, so you can share that sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">9. Connect channels to each other and to your campaign concept</h3>
<p>Being persuasive is important, but so is being consistent. Just when things start feeling boring to you, your community will start to 'get it'. The look and feel of your donation page, the image on your homepage, the URL used in email, social media, and mail should all be the same.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">10. Craft your calendar around deadlines.</h3>
<p>A typical multichannel campaign happens over one-to-two months. If it is a year-end campaign, it will likely start around Thanksgiving and go through early January. Whenever it is, set up a calendar that allows your messages to tell a compelling, coordinated, and cohesive story.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">11. End your campaign with a report-back in all channels.</h3>
<p>It shocks me how many campaigns I see that forget to say thank you at the end and let people know what happened. Even if people didn't give, they like to feel part of the success. And your words of thanks may warm them up for the next time, not to mention make those who did give or act feel even better about it.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">12. Plan how you will capture and analyze key results.</h3>
<p>Before you send that first message, make sure you have the tools you need to capture important metrics, including: open and click-through rates, donation page conversion rates, response rates, and average gift. While the campaign is live, check these statistics and consider changing your approach if things are not working well. And once the campaign is done, be sure to take the time to analyze what happened, compare performance to previous efforts, and map out lessons learned.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2,2063%3,1406%4","Tips for integrated nonprofit campaigns","","","blog 12 ways to make your multichannel campaign stand out","campaigns fundraising online training","campaigns fundraising online training","",

In 2010-2011, we had the pleasure of helping <a href=""/fight-colorectal-cancer-brand"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a> (formerly named Colorectal Cancer Coalition) assess its brand, develop a strategy for what needed to change, refine its messaging and visual identity, and train them on how to rollout and institutionalize the new brand. Though we haven’t worked together since, we stay in touch and have been joyfully watching how they have really brought the brand to life.</p>
<p>Suspecting that their results would be of interest to other nonprofits, I interviewed Carlea Bauman, <a href=""http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/"">Fight Colorectal Cancer</a>’s president, to find out what she’s learned that other nonprofits but also benefit from. Below is a summary of our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to change your brand in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: People were confused about our organization and what made us different from other organization in our space. Also, our name didn’t capture what we did. We felt stuck—like we were walking in mud. Going through brandraising or any significant rebranding process can be scary. Not everyone likes change.</p>
<p><strong>What part was the most difficult?</strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: Getting started was probably the hardest. It was a big investment for us and there was some concern that it might fall flat, would be a waste of time, or that people would hate whatever we came up with. We had to work hard to convince the board that it was a good idea to invest in communications-related research – and the whole brandraising process. Beyond the finances, there was also a lot of worry that we’d change who we were and what who we were working for (survivors). In the end they understood that branding would help us clarify who we were—not change us.</p>
<p><strong>You launched the brand in connection with your annual advocacy event, Call-on Congress.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>How did your advocates--the heart of your community--react when they saw the new brand?</strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: I was ready for there to be pushback, especially knowing that some don't like war terminology (e.g. ‘fight’). But we got none of it—they all loved it. We completed the messaging training with your team a few weeks before and we were ready to go with our talking points. Our advocates shared our enthusiasm for the new brand--they thought it was clearer and bolder.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>If we were to ask your advocates about the new brand (name, logo, tagline, etc.) now, do you think they feel any differently about it two years later?</strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: No, they still love it. I don’t’ think any of them can even remember our old name or look.</p>
<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/-njy2NACLvc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>As we look at how you've implemented the brand across your website, in video, social media, print materials, campaigns, events, office, and more, we are so impressed by how true you've stayed to it and how fresh it all still feels. Has it been easy to use the brand consistently or have you hit road bumps?</strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: No, it’s been very easy. The brandraising guide Big Duck gave us makes it a piece of cake. This past March, we certainly evolved the brand with the launch of a new campaign, <a href=""http://crcmillionstrong.org/%20"" target=""_blank"">One Million Strong</a>. The campaign is bigger and brighter than anything we did before our new brand – and its clear that survivors are still at the heart of who we are and what we do. When people question how ‘glossy’ our materials are, we reiterate that we haven’t changed our core mission…we are just looking better when we do it.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Do you have any advice for nonprofits that are considering going through a branding process or are just at the beginning? </strong></p>
<p>CARLEA: Take time to do some research—with your staff, board, and community. Be honest when it comes to answering questions about what you are trying to change and what you want out of it.

First, there’s all the work that’s happening behind the scenes before the new identity is shared with the public. Then there’s the process of updating everything. Lastly, there’s maintenance: updates and adjustments to keep the brand on track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Earlier this week, I visited a large nonprofit that recently changed its visual identity and messaging. &nbsp;Along the way, I was struck by all the instances where their new logo, colors, and design system were already in use – and a few places were it wasn’t. Even large institutions (or, perhaps, especially large institutions) struggle to update everything seamlessly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This organization had ‘flipped the switch’ on their new brand in a few ways other nonprofits might learn from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posters with the new mission statement in public spaces</li>
<li>A redesigned newsletter printed and available in the lobby areas</li>
<li>Guest wifi access page redesigned with the new visual identity and messages</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In some areas, the old brand was still in evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business cards in programs waiting areas reflected a mix of the old and new logo</li>
<li>Accent walls in programs spaces were painted with the old- not the new- brand colors</li>
<li>Old signage on the walls</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Who can blame them? The bottom line is that updating everything takes time and costs money. If you’re rebranding, here are a three tips to help you tackle your roll out.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p>
<ol>
<li>Remember that most people will connect with your nonprofit through 5 primary channels: online, in print, on air, in person, and mobile. Start by identifying all the communications tools use use in each of these areas. For example, under online, you might list website, Facebook, Twitter, email templates, microsites, and any other online tools you use to communicate. Under in person you might list your signage, office furnishings, and handouts.</li>
<li>Budget to update in phases. It’s hardly realistic to do it all at once, so plan to start with the most visible pieces (probably your website, social media, and core printed materials) and systematically reprint or develop new templates at key junctures. &nbsp;As you make the list I suggested in the first tip, consider scoring each item (1-10) for its visibility and importance. You might also want to build a ‘brand updates’ line item into your communications budget for the next 2 years just to play it safe.</li>
<li>Don’t forget the hidden or automated stuff. It’s easy, as a staff person, to set something up and forget about it- like the thank you page or automatic email people get after they make a donation online, for instance. To be sure you’ve updated everything with your new brand, put yourself in the shoes of your donors, clients, board members, peers and volunteers. Test out what happens when you take the actions they’d take. Make a donation online, sign up for the newsletter, call the main number to hear the voice mail system recording, and so on. You’ll uncover all sorts of little places you can roll out your new brand.</li>

As an intern at Big Duck I’ve heard a lot of stories of organizations trying to make an app when they don’t have any real reason for one. Before you shell out some money and effort, think about this question: what is your app for? The way I see it, there are four reasons for an app:</p>
<p><br /><strong>For entertainment.</strong> Whether waiting for the subway or going out for brunch, you’ll always find people playing on their phones. Chances are, most of them are wasting time on Angry Birds or Snapchat. This kind of app is pretty difficult to develop, especially if you want it to have meaningful content, but it can be a good way to get people interested in you and the content you have off the app.</p>
<p><br /><strong>For urgency.</strong> Whenever I get frustrated at the subway for making me late, I go to one of the many apps out there to see if my train is running late or just not coming. This kind of app is where the more serious content is usually used, helping people learn to cook or even to respond natural disasters. These apps may vary in the urgency of content but they all have one important factor: simple interfaces. If I download an app and it’s too slow or cumbersome to use I delete it the same day.</p>
<p><br /><strong>For simplicity.</strong> Between classes, my job, and my internship here at Big Duck, I don’t get to sit still for very long. If your target audience is anything like me, they’ll only be able to answer an online call-to-action that takes less than 5 minutes. Anything longer than that needs to be approachable via web as well as mobile, which is my next point.</p>
<p><br /><strong>For Continuity.</strong> Given my packed schedule, there are always things that need to be done in multiple sittings, if I get to sit at all! For example, I often begin writing an email on my laptop and then finish it on my phone as I wait in the morning coffee line. If you want your audience to engage more than 5 minutes a day, make sure the connections between online and mobile channels are seamless.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you want to make an app to fulfill one or more of these uses you are off to a great start! If you’re hoping to target my generation you’ll need to make sure you have these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetics: a well-designed app doesn’t just run well, but it looks good. If it looks outdated people will think it is, and won’t trust its information.</li>
<li>Give and take: I love to support a cause and get involved, but because I have so many ads online asking me for something everyday, I tend to get selective. If you want an audience of my generation to get involved, give them something in return – even something small like a tweet saying thanks or a chance to win free flip flops.</li>

Even though I’ve embraced the mp3 as much as the next guy, I’m old enough that buying music is still a habit. Plus, I have musician family members, and I don’t like to steal from them.</p>
<p>But most people don’t buy music anymore. Especially young people. A singer-songwriter I like recently wrote a blog post about coming to terms with this fact. He relies almost solely on ticket sales to his live shows.</p>
<p>Then, after viewing Amanda Palmer’s TedTalk on the Art of Asking and witnessing the wild success of the <i>Veronica Mars</i> Kickstarter campaign (more than 90,000 fans of the TV show invested nearly $6,000,000 for a movie version), this singer-songwriter made a pitch of his own.</p>
<p>With the loss of revenue from album sales, it was getting harder and harder for him to return to the studio. If people wanted new music, they’d need to help him.</p>
<p>It turned out that his fans loved being a part of something two-directional. Rather than a simple transaction (he makes music; they buy/don’t buy music), he let them own a part of the creative process. He raised the money he needed for his project nearly overnight. And he posted a video of his obvious genuine emotion and surprise at the outpouring of support.</p>
<p>This is probably why your most ardent donors give to your organization. They love being a part of the important work you do. It’s not just <i>that</i> you change lives; it’s <i>how</i> you change lives.</p>
<p>We see this in the way some of our clients work with us, as well. Some come to us just wanting a perfect logo (or other final product). Like me, they’re still buying the music. And there’s certainly nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Others invest in our process. They become valuable partners in the creation of their new identity. They bring a content expert’s point-of-view to their new messaging. They help us find unexpected opportunities in an awareness campaign. They go through the ups and downs of the creative process with us. We sometimes defer to their expertise; they sometimes defer to ours. We push each other and challenge each other. We occasionally get frustrated. We often find joy in the collaboration. We experience setbacks and successes, and we go through them all together.</p>
<p>And in the end, it’s incredibly rewarding. The new identity, messaging document, campaign, website—whatever the final music is in this overblown metaphor—belongs to us all. We can look at the creative work in front of us and know that we had a role in shaping its beauty.</p>
<p>That’s awfully great.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1066%2,1415%3,1410%4","Big Duck Blog | Invest in the process","","","invest in the process","logo identity process branding brandraising","logo identity process branding brandraising","",

<p>It’s a Mark Twain quote often referenced in many a conversation about the value of brevity.</p>
<p>There’s some truth to it, of course. It takes time to write sharp, concise prose—often much more time than it takes to write something of greater length.</p>
<p>And, like many of my colleagues, I think it’s absolutely worthwhile to spend that extra time trimming the fat and removing gratuitous language, whether words from sentences, sentences from paragraphs, or entire paragraphs from whatever it is you’re writing.</p>
<p>Less worthwhile, though, is removing necessary language for the sake of brevity. Ultimately, writing needs to inform, and the information needs to be getting across. Rather than striving for short, we should strive for clear. (Though the two often tend to go hand in hand.)</p>
<p>For instance, <a href=""http://topnonprofits.com/examples/nonprofit-mission-statements/"">take Top Nonprofits’ examples of 50 different mission statements</a>, which range in length from two words to 235. Mission statements in general, not just those on the list, have a tendency to suffer from wordiness, and from jargon in particular.</p>
<p>Looking through the various mission statements, it’s obvious that we should always aim for clarity. The statements that feel most successful to me are those that say neither too much nor too little but just enough; the ones that avoid jargon but include as many details as it takes to justify an organization’s mission and, ideally, differentiate it from similar ones.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1416%2,1409%3","Big Duck Blog | What's better than brevity?

There are so many new opportunities to connect with your supporters, learn more about what makes them tick, and get them fired up about the great work you do, but so little time to do it all.</p>
<p>Diving into your website analytics, segmenting your email list, investigating the latest social platform, doing audience research, planning your year-end fundraising campaign, reading the latest whitepaper… you’re excited to do all of it, but how do you find the time amidst everyday things like writing your email newsletter or posting to your Facebook page? And where do you start?</p>
<p>It might sound overly simple, but one of the best ways to get on top of it all is to tackle the big things first—the items on your to-do list that will have the biggest impact on your communications.</p>
<p>It’s an idea that’s sometimes referred to as “big rocks first” (<a href=""http://zenhabits.net/big-rocks-first-double-your-productivity-this-week/"" target=""_blank"">hat tip to Zen Habits</a>, among other places we Ducks read about it).The basic principle is that you should focus on finding time to fit in the big things first (like planning your communications for the quarter), and then fit the smaller, less-important tasks in around them (like re-proofreading all of your scheduled tweets).</p>
<p>It works a little something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of the most important things you need to do to keep your nonprofit communicating as effectively as possible. Not the everyday tasks, but the things that you know will have a big impact on your communications (and which you’ve probably been putting off because you’re so busy).</li>
<li>Identify the three to five most important.</li>
<li>Look at your organization’s calendar for the next few months (or years) and figure out when you can tackle those most important projects.</li>
<li>Make time every week to work on them—and fit the small, everyday things in around them until the bigger things are done (or at least well under way).</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy, but which “big rocks” should you start with? A few big things have come up again and again in our work with nonprofits that might start you thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/audience-research/"" target=""_blank"">Make time to do a little audience research</a>, so you know who you’re trying to reach, how they want to connect with you, and what they’re interested in (rather than just sending untargeted communications out into a black hole).</li>
<li>Take time out from sending emails on the fly to develop a <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bigducknyc/developing-a-communications-strategy-for-your-nonprofit"" target=""_blank"">communications strategy</a> and <a href=""http://www.lightboxcollaborative.com/2013-editorial-calendar"" target=""_blank"">editorial calendar</a> (even a very basic one) to make sure you’re communicating with the right people about the right things at the right time.</li>
<li><a href=""/wanna-raise-money-online-do-not-forget-about-email"" target=""_blank"">Make sure you have a solid website and email program in place</a> before worrying about getting up to speed with the latest social media platform like Instagram, Vine, or the next big thing to come.</li>

","Elizabeth Ricca","1049","","<p>If you ever work on a project with Big Duck, you'll find that we're very resistant to listing ""general public"" as an audience. (And don't try to get away with ""everyone else"" or ""the broader community""—we're onto you!)</p>","<p>If you ever work on a project with Big Duck, you'll find that we're very resistant to listing ""general public"" as an audience. (And don't try to get away with ""everyone else"" or ""the broader community""—we're onto you!)</p>
<p>First off, it's usually not realistic—most nonprofits can't afford the kind of advertising push needed to reach a very general audience. But even if you do have the means to do a marketing blitz, the general public still probably isn't the best target from a strategic point of view.</p>
<p>It's a hard line to draw—don't you want everyone to know about the work you do or the program you're running? Shouldn't you aspire to appeal (or at least be known) as broadly as possible?</p>
<p>Maybe; maybe not. The most powerful nonprofit brands have a clear mission and a point of view, and that means not everyone is going to agree with the way they do things. The Girl Scouts, ASPCA, Planned Parenthood—even organizations like the Red Cross that seem like they should have almost universal appeal. Every organization has its champions and its critics, and there will always be those who disagree with your strategy or your priorities or maybe even your mission. ""Please all, and you will please none""—it's an idea as old as Aesop (probably older). And in the context of communications, it means that a message targeted at a generic, neutral audience might not offend—but it also might fail to inspire the people who should be your most ardent supporters.</p>
<p>So if you want to be effective in your communications, it's important to identify what piece of the ""general public"" you really want to reach. It's not as difficult as it sounds.</p>
<p>Let's imagine your organization is doing a campaign to get kittens adopted. You want to reach beyond the usual suspects (the people who are already excited about adopting kittens and who do so regularly). Ideally, everyone in your community will be aware of this opportunity and intrigued by the potential benefits of kitten adoption. After all, even you reach someone who isn't quite ready to adopt a kitten herself, maybe she has a friend who'd be interested. And someday when she IS ready to adopt a kitten, she'll think of you.</p>
<p>It's tempting to think that all of this adds up to wanting to reach the general public, but we can do better. Let's start with thinking more about who the best prospects are for kitten adoption. They probably have the means to own a pet, are pretty responsible, and have a realistic sense of what's involved in caring for a kitten. They've probably owned a pet of some kind before. Suddenly, we have a much sharper picture of who we're talking to—and maybe some interesting ideas about where we can find them or what kind of messages could appeal to them. We might eventually decide that the best tactics for reaching this group are broad-based, like TV ads or posters that will be seen by a much wider audience, but we know whose eye we're trying to catch—and we're okay with the fact that a lot of those other people might tune us out.</p>
<p>Maybe your secondary goal is to get more people receptive to the idea of kitten adoption. Even then, we can identify some specific sub-sets of the ""general public"" to target—like educated young people who may have the means to adopt in another 3-5 years, or people of any age looking for a different way to bring companionship and meaning into their lives. Sometimes you might need a little research to inform these decisions, but the point is that it's possible to be specific—and the more specific you are, the more successful (and efficient) you'll be.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1409%2,2063%3,1408%4","Big Duck Blog | Hello General Public","","","hello general public","brandraising campaigns audience online personality","brandraising campaigns audience online personality","<p>Image by&nbsp;Milo Winter</p>",

<p>You can probably imagine, then, the combination of premature nostalgia and giddiness that I experienced when I stumbled upon <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/breaking-bad-loves-albuquerque.html"" target=""_blank"">this sweet little ad</a> the <em>Breaking Bad</em> team has plastered over a ton of billboards in Albuquerque, thanking the southwestern city it’s called home for the past five or so years. Beyond my appreciation of these billboards as a fan of the show, the copywriter in me has found a thing or two to like about it as well. Allow me to summarize.</p>
<p><strong>Authenticity </strong></p>
<p>Watch any interview with the show’s creator or cast and you’ll quickly realize the deep respect they have for Albuquerque, which has become as much a crucial character as it is a setting. Regardless of how something is executed, a strong message has to be there in the first place, and this one happens to be particularly genuine and heartfelt.</p>
<p><strong>Originality</strong></p>
<p>At Big Duck, we try to develop things that are unique to our clients, whether it’s a tagline that says something only they can say or a truly ownable logo. These ads are a good illustration of what that means. Sure, any show can claim to have great “chemistry” with the city where it’s filmed, but for <em>Breaking Bad</em>, a show that’s all about the dark side of chemistry, the phrase takes on a whole new meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Personality</strong></p>
<p>I’m a big fan of wordplay, but it doesn’t always work in every context. Here, though, it feels successful. The play on words, with the double meaning of chemistry, sets the tone for the ad, something along the lines of sincere-yet-playful. (The second exclamation point, however, I think they can stand to lose. Maybe even the first.)</p>

Maybe your personality has long been defined by a charismatic founder or leader who's transitioning out, and you need to seek out your own identity as an organization. Maybe your communications look pretty disorganized and uncoordinated to an outside eye, but you're actually a remarkably efficient, effective deliverer of programs.

<p>Sure, our branding is playful by design.

<p>Living and working ‘on brand’ like that helps keep us all mindful of how we’re communicating.

No!</p>","<p>Brandraising is a long, and sometimes painful, process. It starts with a lot of research and ends, hopefully, with the launch of a new identity that is embraced wholeheartedly by your community. What role does your board of directors play in this process? Do they need to like your new brand in order to move forward?</p>
<p>Board buy-in is certainly key to the success of your new brand; after all, the board members are your lead brand ambassadors. But do they need to like it? No! The questions they need to answer “yes” to are these: Does the new brand reflect the state of your organization and position you for future growth? Does it speak to your constituents? Does it support the communication of your key messages?</p>
<p>Think of your new brand like a new outfit. In the past, you wore sleeveless dresses to your job. But you have gained experience and are ready to advance in your career to a more corporate position. You realize you need to dress the part so off to the mall you go. You take a look at the suits and they don’t look good on the hanger. You try them on and they are a little uncomfortable. But you realize that you need to dress in a way that represents who you have become and positions you for career growth. You realize that wearing a suit reflects these needs so you buy a couple and start wearing them to work. In a short time, you realize that your appearance now represents who you are, supports your key messages about your experience and expertise, and puts you in a position to work towards your career goals.</p>
<p>How can you help your Board understand this concept? After Big Duck laid the framework through the research and evidence they presented to our board, we at The Marfan Foundation were able to take ownership and “sell” the brand, starting with our board of directors. I found one-on-one presentations, in person when possible, the most effective for this continued education about branding and the discussion of our new brand. I did this several months prior to our brand launch to give our board members time to learn, absorb, and ask questions before we expected them to own it and champion it to our constituents.</p>
<p>Change is hard, but if you’ve done it right, your board will understand, embrace, and champion your new brand as you need them to do for a successful launch to your community. As one of our members said, the new brand is “an evolution, not a revolution.” It was probably one of the best comments I heard as we gave our board members and a few other VIPs the inside track on the new brand.</p>
<p>And, as many members realized when we <a href=""http://marfan.org/marfan/5862/The-Marfan-Foundation-Adopts-New-Brand-to-Better-Reflect-its-Mission-for-Marfan-Syndrome-and-Related-Disorders"" target=""_parent"">launched our new brand</a> at our annual family conference in August, it doesn’t matter if they like the brand or not. What is important is if they can own the brand and embrace it. So when asked: will it help us create a brighter future for everyone living with Marfan syndrome and related disorders? The overwhelming response was a resounding “yes!”</p>

It’s easy to rely on them. Less easy, though, is knowing when it’s time to move on from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m one of those people who take issue with the very idea of best practices. After all, the stuff we call “best practices” inevitably started out as something new and blatantly non-best-practice-y. They probably came into being because someone decided to question whatever systems were in place and innovate, which is precisely what we stop doing once we become overly reliant on best practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To borrow from <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemyatt/2012/08/15/best-practices-arent/"">another argument against best practices:</a> “One of the most common reasons for pursuing best practices in a given area is to avoid having to ‘reinvent the wheel.’ Think about it like this—if nobody ever reinvented the wheel, they’d still be made from stone…Maintenance doesn’t lead you forward—creation does.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the very nature of best practices implies a one-size-fits-all approach; if one company had success with a certain strategy, that doesn’t necessarily mean a completely different business will.</p>
<p>And even if they were entirely unproblematic as a concept, best practices are never really here to stay: In an ever-changing world like ours, what’s relevant today may no longer be so tomorrow. In fact, it probably won’t be. Remember when a certain web design best practice advised us to keep our content above the fold (the part on the page where we begin to scroll)? But nowadays, the way we use the internet and interact with pages is changing. And given that we now use tablets, smart phones, and monitors of all shapes and sizes to browse the web, the fold itself isn’t the fixed thing it once was.</p>
<p>The point being, of course, that it’s important to constantly question “best practices,” to treat them as a starting point, to adapt rather than adopt them. Because, at the end of the day, I can’t help but worry that best practices might be getting in the way of even better practices.&nbsp;</p>

I’m sure most of us have heard the point-of-view that if the substance is good enough, the style doesn’t matter so much.&nbsp;But with so little separating the substance of your mission and communicating that substance, that’s not enough anymore.</p>","<p>My wife recently presented at a conference, so I tagged along to take in the sites of a city I’ve never visited before. But I also crashed three of the conference presentations, including a keynote address, which was one of the more fascinating and frustrating presentations I’ve seen.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker is pretty well known, and she’s one of the only people talking about issues of privilege—especially around race, gender, and sexual identity—in this particular field. The content was terrific. Just outstanding stuff.</p>
<p>And it took everything I had to pay attention. In general, I don’t have an awful attention span. It’s getting a bit worse with age, I admit, but with content this good, my mind shouldn’t have been wandering.</p>
<p>There were a few specifics I think we could all learn from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t read your speech. Or if you are reading, practice it enough that it doesn’t sound like you’re reading it.</li>
<li>Don’t use PowerPoint to write out all of your content. If we’re reading, we’re not listening to you.</li>
<li>Tell stories. When the speaker spoke from personal experience, the audience was way more engaged than when talking in generalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss style as unimportant. I’m sure most of us have heard the point-of-view that if the substance is good enough, the style doesn’t matter so much. Translated to the nonprofit world, maybe it’s more like this: if the work we do is good enough, people will pay attention or get involved or make a donation.</p>
<p>But that’s not enough anymore, as I think most nonprofiteers are now realizing. At Big Duck, we often talk about how some of the most rewarding projects we do are the ones in which we help an organization’s brand match (or catch up to) the quality of its work.</p>
<p>So don’t dismiss style. There’s very little separation these days between the substance of your mission and communicating that substance to your audiences.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,2059%2,1409%3","Big Duck Blog | Matching substance with style","","","matching substance with style","style speaking presentation substance audiences","brandraising messaging webinar workshop speaking","<p>Image by Paula Caroline</p>",

<p>So what does it take to craft an awesome, compelling email that prompts supporters not only to read, but to take action? That's what we'd like to discuss in this September's blog carnival.&nbsp;(Wondering what a blog carnival is?&nbsp;<a href=""#carnival"">Step right this way</a>.)</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Here's how the carnival works.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>If you're a blogger</strong>, the fun begins now. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write up a post with examples, suggestions, cautionary tales, interesting tests you've run—anything you like, really, as long as involves nonprofit emails. Feel free to send us a past post if you've written something recently that fits the bill.</li>
<li>Email your permalink to&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:nonprofitcarnival@gmail.com"" target=""_blank"">nonprofitcarnival@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>Monday, 9/23</strong>&nbsp;(and tell your friends to do the same).</li>
<li>We'll sift through the many excellent entries and choose the ones that work best with our theme. Posts that are easy to read and were written relatively recently (within the last month or two) are best. A good duck pun or two will probably get you extra points.</li>
<li>Check back at the Duck Call on Thursday, 9/26 to see if we've included your post, and enjoy a bump in traffic as we promote the Carnival to friends and followers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you're a reader</strong>, stay tuned—we'll be back at the end of September with a roundup of all the great resources we've collected from nonprofits and experts around the web with tips, examples, best practices, and ideas for making the most of your emails.

The Unreasonable Institute is a social entrepreneur incubator where for six weeks each year, they host a handful of social entrepreneurs from around the world, whose businesses have both profitable </span><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">and</span><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> social bottom-lines. Unreasonable connects these entrepreneurs to skilled mentors for guidance on their financial models, and provides access to “impact-investors”, accredited investors who want to pursue a financial agreement that has a positive social impact.</span></p>
<p><span><span><br /><span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The questions that arise with this crowd are similar questions that plague many nonprofits today, ‘How can an organization measure social good? And, what does success even look like?’ Unfortunately, we did not figure out the answers to these tough questions (sigh), but it did cause me to question the growing role of measurement in the nonprofit arena, and subsequently, the critical importance of nonprofits to communicate their successes (or failures) to their donors in as a crucial part of their fundraising efforts. </span></p>
<p><span><span><br /><span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The </span><a href=""http://philanthropy.com/blogs/measuring-up/how-to-impress-donors-with-your-programs-in-a-tough-economy/145""><span>Chronicle of Philanthropy</span></a><span> believes that the ability of nonprofit to measure their programs success is now a “must have” rather than a “nice-to-have.” Other reputable sources, including the </span><a href=""http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/management/22549-using-outcomes-to-measure-nonprofit-success.html""><span>Nonprofit Quarterly</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=""http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6401.htm""><span>Harvard Business Review</span></a><span> both wrote articles within the last month discussing how donors are now looking for more robust data to inform their donation decisions.

<p><span><span><br /><span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So, as donors gets smarter, nonprofits will need to invest in resources to figure out what all of this measurement mumbo jumbo is about, AND how to best convey and integrate these results into their regular communications to donors.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a tough world out there for nonprofits, dealing with smaller government budgets and more inquisitive donors. I do not envy the position most nonprofit communications employees are in, but I do know those nonprofits who chose to invest in measurement infrastructure, and adequately relay this information immediately to their donors, will be well on their way to satisfying their curious patrons. The more organized and strategic nonprofits will be able to woo donors away from those nonprofits who are unable to articulate their actual effect on their clients. Get ahead of the competition, figure out if your programs are in fact achieving your mission and if they are- tell your donors and fast. </span></p>

The other 70% takes place in Alaska. It was really a matter of time before I took a break from being an art director to go live in a yurt in Maine and learn all there is to know about housebuilding. I mean really, I should have seen this coming.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I discovered <a href=""http://www.shelterinstitute.com/"" target=""_parent"">Shelter Institute</a>&nbsp;while reading a <a href=""http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/why-i-want-a-cabin/"" target=""_parent"">New York Times blog</a>&nbsp;about a cabin build. They were offering a two-week program for at the ""homeowner/builder"" who wanted to build their own house. Perfect.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/sample_cabin.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""462"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">My goal was to hack together something like this place, deep in the woods, really far away from the daily obsession of food trucks and Instagram. It might be a place to get some fresh air, do some fishing, and build a few unnecessarily large camp fires. Seems simple enough right?</p>
<p class=""p1"">When I signed up for the class I rented this wooden spaceship, a good test run of what my cabin experience might be like way in the future. It's unclear whether that future is in 1970 or 2070. Either way, it was great.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/yurt.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""476"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">Most days, the neighbor's roosters work me up. I'd wash the dishes and myself in the outdoor shower (the only place with running water), listen to some Lewiston NPR and down a cup of coffee made over my camp stove.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Class was from 8:30 to 5:30 with workshops afterward in things like chainsaw maintenance or the nuances of operating a 15 ton excavator.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/chainsaw.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""476"" /><br /><br />The excavator was...great.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/excavator.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""476"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">The lectures unearthed, somewhat unsuccessfully, ancient grade-school knowledge about science and math that I slowly shed with the arrival of Google. As I waded into the very complicated principles of calculating point loads, wiring a house, or testing my own soil, I realized quickly, I really had no clue what I was doing when it came to housebuilding. HGTV makes it look way too easy.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/class.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""476"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">It was a humbling to say the least and taught me a few things. I learned that my arms are way too flimsy to be working all day with a chisel and mallet.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/chisel.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""542"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">I learned that wiring your own home is complicated, but completely doable. <br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/electric.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""476"" /><br /><br />And I learned that Maine has some pretty great typography in unexpected places.<br /><br /><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/851a5749aa33d672968e776a8f6a9317/files/type_1.jpg"" width=""635"" height=""477"" /></p>
<p class=""p1"">The class was equally about building to code as it was about creating something permanent and great. ""Build something that will last a lifetime,"" they told us. ""You don't want to be an old man fixing a leak on your roof."" And that's a lesson as important for nonprofits as it is for home builders.<br /><br />When it came down to it, they were really just talking about what makes for good design: employing careful planning and expertise to produce something that will stand the test of time. It's easy to forget that what you do now sets the stage for everything you do later. Investing in a solid foundation in communications, just as in construction, can save you a lot of hassle fixing mistakes later. Building this way takes knowledge and hard work, and it turns out, hiring an expert is actually sometimes better than doing it yourself (I'm looking at you, logo DIYers!).</p>
<p class=""p1"">But don't you worry, the cabin of my dreams is still alive and well, it just now has its imaginary foundation poured by an imaginary concrete company. I still plan on doing the rest of the build myself someday. Armed with some newfound knowledge, this actually feels possible.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Do yourself a favor, go someplace where you're not the expert, take copious notes, and re-learn how to learn. It just might make you a better expert.<br /><br />(<a href=""http://cabinporn.com/post/57536545665/shingled-cabin-on-the-island-of-islesboro-maine"" target=""_parent"">image credit</a>)</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1416%1,1415%2,1409%3,1410%4","Big Duck Blog | Designing foundations for tomorrow","","","designing the foundation for tomorrows message today","blog messaging foundation process experts copywriting design logo tagline nonprofit future","blog messaging foundation process experts copywriting design logo tagline nonprofit","",

But instead of shouting over one another, how can your organization navigate that crowded pond?</p>","<p>In the nonprofit world it can be uncomfortable to think about the question “Who are your competitors?” After all, nonprofits exist to make a positive impact, not to compete for a slice of market share. &nbsp;Most organizations refer to groups tackling similar issues as “peers” not as “competitors.” And with good reason. &nbsp;If the purpose of a nonprofit is to set out on a mission to solve a particular societal problem, then the more independent actors working on it the better. Right?</p>
<p>When it comes to communications, the answer can be pretty tricky. As much as we may want to resist, nonprofits compete with one another every day—for limited funding, resources, and attention. &nbsp;Getting heard in this noisy world is a challenge unto itself; even more so when there’s a bunch of other nonprofits talking about the same issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of shouting over one another, how can your organization navigate a crowded pond?</p>
<p>A simple way to start is by getting to know your peer organizations a bit better - what some people refer to as a landscape assessment. It’s a research method that prompts you to break outside of your organization’s office and survey the field in which you’re situated.</p>
<p>Ready to try it out? &nbsp;Begin by making a list of a few peer organizations. &nbsp;If you’re not sure who they are you could ask your staff, volunteers, board, or even committed donors to help you figure it out. What organizations was a donor wavering between when she gave to your last campaign? What are the go-to organizations that people think of when they consider the issue area you are working on? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you know who your peers are, take some time to evaluate how these organizations communicate. &nbsp;Pull up their websites, subscribe to their newsletters, read their fundraising materials, and follow them on social media. &nbsp;Take a close look at their logos and taglines. &nbsp;What is the style in which they talk to their followers? Jot down a few personality traits that surface through these mediums. Is their style institutional? Grassroots? Edgy? Who do you think your peers are most focused on reaching? What are their prevailing messages? What channels are they using the most?<br /> <br />Draw on this research as you consider your own organization’s identity. Understanding who your peers are and how they communicate can help you gain clarity about what makes your group unique. &nbsp;In this way, the goal of communications becomes less about competing with those in your space, and more about carving out your organization’s own niche - so that there’s more opportunity for everyone to be heard.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1413%2,1407%3","Big Duck Blog | Sharing your pond","","","big duck blog who shares your nonprofit pond","positioning identity brandraising pond competition fundraising","positioning identity competition fundraising","",

One independent school shares their beliefs, approach, and dreams, somewhat unexpectedly.</span></p>","<p>“<i>We believe education is a rich, subtle exploration and questioning of the world, not a means to an end. Since 1965 Saint Ann's School has brought together gifted children and passionate teachers in a fierce pursuit of knowledge, skill, and artistry. We cultivate a joy for learning through a deep and rigorous curriculum, in which the arts are an essential presence. So that every child will flourish, we eschew grades, rankings, and prizes in favor of ongoing dialogue and teacher reports. At Saint Ann's we offer our dreams to those who will share theirs with us.”<br /><br /></i></p>
<p>This independent school’s mission statement does a few things you don’t often see:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>It starts with a statement of beliefs to provide context for the mission. </b>If you don’t share Saint Ann’s School’s values and beliefs, they want you to know it up front.&nbsp; This isn’t a school for everyone; it’s for those who believe that education is an exploration.</li>
<li><b>It’s not afraid to be passionate and distinguishing.</b> “Fierce” and “eschew” are words you’d don’t read in every mission statement; they set a tone and take a stand. Focusing on the arts and process as an approach to curriculum also helps the reader understand how the experiences at this school might be different.</li>
<li><b>It ends with an aspirational call to action.</b> I was surprised to see the idea of ‘dreaming’ in a school’s mission statement, but in the context of this mission, it makes sense because it circles back to the beliefs and values that are the undercurrent of this mission. It also serves as a springboard from this mission statement into the future.<br /><br /></li>

For the first time, when my turn came around, I didn’t know what to write about. I was blocked. Then someone, I suspect in an attempt to be a smartass, suggested that I write about where good ideas come from.<br /><br /> We all run out of gas from time to time. For the creative department at Big Duck, the ongoing challenge is being able to do great work as we “create-on-demand” for clients and colleagues. We don’t always know where inspiration comes from—or when it will strike. <br /><br />And all of us are juggling several projects at once, each with its own unique demands. So some projects invariably end up getting more inspiration, while others get more of the perspiration. <br /><br />If you traffic in ideas at your job—and I would argue that most people working in communications and development do just that—you might check out <a href=""http://www.accidentalcreative.com/"" target=""_parent"">Todd Henry and The Accidental Creative</a>. He’s probably doing the best work I’ve seen on helping professional “creatives” build processes to help us stay creative and healthy. <br /><br />For example, he recommends setting aside a little bit of time every week to do some free play—just a bit of creating that has no purpose at all. It can be making a collage, or sketching with charcoal, or free writing. It’s so simple, and yet it’s something I’ve let slide for a while now. <br /><br />Maybe that’s why it was so hard to come up with an idea for this blog post.

Copywriting Interns yet to come, pay attention...</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Less is more—except when more is more.</h2>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""/what-is-better-than-brevity-clarity"">As previously illustrated by Katherine Lindstedt</a>, good writing is a very written thing—it’s been shaped, trimmed, shortened and compacted, transformed from a flabby, imprecise blob into a honed wording machine that makes its points without overstaying its welcome. It’s one of the most satisfying things about being a writer, the process of &nbsp;chipping away at a slab of English until, fleck by fleck, its sleekest fraction appears. (No, I’m not actually a sculptor, I just really like analogies.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That being said, however, don’t let brevity become a fetish. If something’s complex and multifaceted, don’t simplify for simplicity’s sake or omit details just to fulfill some prescribed idealised pithiness. Sometimes words need allies. Don’t abandon them.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">When it comes to taglines (of which you will write a million squillion, I assure you)...</h2>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Imitate Alexander the Great (just without the delusions of grandeur and imperialism): but seriously, take a moment to ruminate, then cut a swath through that foreboding blank page in pursuit of eternal tagline glory. It’s liberating. You’ll find a groove and more than likely turn up some interesting results. Go for it.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Think laterally: allow your mind to flow sideways, almost tangentially. Travel through space and line, brainstorming, word associating, in search of truth and sentence transcendence to a tagline Valhalla where a countless thousand taglines feast and slay clichés. Then quickly write them all down before you forget.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Judge yourself: be objective. Do your taglines fulfill the brief? Do they reflect the organization’s personality and positioning? Have you pretty much written the same taglines twice, changed the organization’s mission and forgotten their goals? Yeah, I thought so. Comb through it. Be selective. Keep the literal, the experimental, and the cadence making. Now go get feedback. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">The three laws of Duckbotics.</h2>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Vampire Weekend may be decidedly apathetic about the Oxford Comma, but the Ducks are fans. For those of you who consider it weird, unnatural, and discombobulating, you have my sympathy. But just humor them, ok? &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">“Impact” is a no-no word. Seriously, never use it. Never ever. Banish it to the cerebral equivalent of Siberia. Cast it into the fiery core of Mount Doom. Hide it in the wood shed and never mention it again. Got it?</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Under no circumstances should you get a grilled cheese sandwich from the grilled cheese sandwich van. There be revolting dragons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">And the nub of it?</h2>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Although it’s possible (very technically speaking), it’s unlikely you’ll intern at another place quite like Big Duck. The Ducks are clever and generous, the office is a productive banterous reading room, you’ll be given real work on real projects for real clients, and by the end of it, after thousands of words and excellent tutelage, you’ll be a great catch for employers.<br /><br />But that’s not the best thing. The best thing is you get to keep your soul. That’s right; no flogging cigarettes to kids or squeezing snake oil here. Instead you’ll learn—as I have—that Big Duck works with nonprofits who, selflessly and without much fanfare, champion important but sometimes unsung causes, courageously doing their bit to improve the human experience. &nbsp;<br /><br />And you, Copywriting Intern, get to write for them; you get to make the world a little fairer, a little more informed, and a slightly better place to live. You get to make a real imp---------------<br /><br />(CATASTROPHIC HARD DRIVE FAILURE. DATA RECOVERY INCOMPLETE.

Facilitated by Jane McIntosh (Vice President for Philanthropy, <a href=""http://www.centralparknyc.org/"" target=""_parent"">Central Park Conservancy</a>), it featured panelists Abigail Healy (Associate Vice President of Membership and Communications, Central Park Conservancy), Kristel Kempin (Coordinator, Individual Giving, <a href=""http://lc.lincolncenter.org/"" target=""_parent"">Lincoln Center</a>), and Megan Sanko (Senior Development Officer, <a href=""http://www.wcs.org/"" target=""_parent"">Wildlife Conservation Society)</a>. Each of the three panelists bared all of the details of their young patron’s programs—from strategies, budgets (very low!), and staffing, to the databases and email systems they use.&nbsp; Here are a few takeaways:<br /><br /></i><b>Younger donor programs are a long-range strategy. </b>While each of the three organizations featured have specific income and membership targets for their young donor programs, they are a fraction of the organization’s overall operating budget. The expectation is that the program will, in time, surface tomorrow’s major donor or board member, not add significant income in the short-term.</p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p3""><b>Younger patrons will pay for a good time.</b> These three organizations develop really cool events on shoestring budgets and get very creative with location, food, speakers, and booze. Most have found that an event with a reasonable entrance fee (a $50 or less ticket price) is just as (or more!) successful than a free event. They’re all experimenting with social media, friendraising, and other ways to help millennials connect with each other and their institutions beyond events, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p3""><b>Young patrons want a drink.</b> Yep, you heard me. Serve booze. They also want to network, give back, and see the impact of their support. Ask them what they want and they’ll tell you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p3"">Abigail Healy from Central Park Conservancy also talked about her organization’s rebranding as an effective asset to engage younger donors. “Young appeals to young and old,” she said, “but old doesn’t appeal to young.”</p>

<p><strong>Tips, examples, best practices, and ideas for creating powerful, effective emails.</strong></p>
<p>Try your luck with one of these smart posts (really, you can't go wrong):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Begin at the beginning: the envelope</strong>. As&nbsp;Claire Axelrad of Clairification points out, <a href=""http://www.clairification.com/2013/09/22/get-your-nonprofit-email-opened-take-a-quack-at-it/"" target=""_blank"">your sender and subject line (the ""envelope"") are the first thing your reader will see</a>,&nbsp;and they're often the deciding factor in whether she clicks or deletes. So make them count. (Claire also&nbsp;takes home the grand prize for the most extensive use of duck language and imagery!)</li>
<li><strong>No, seriously—the envelope</strong>. Joanne Fritz (Carnival organizer extraordinaire!) has some helpful guidance on <a href=""http://nonprofit.about.com/b/2013/09/23/is-your-email-quacking-to-be-opened.htm?nl=1"" target=""_blank"">crafting an effective subject line that will have your message ""quacking to be opened.""</a></li>
<li><strong>Keep your promises</strong>.&nbsp;Whether you think about it this way or not, you've made a promise to your email subscribers to deliver relevant content—and if you break that promise, you can't expect them to keep listening and clicking and giving. Nancy Schwartz on Getting Attention has some <a href=""http://gettingattention.org/2013/09/nonprofit-email-expectations/"" target=""_blank"">good ideas for keeping an eye on the prize: providing real value to your subscribers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Make your content contagious</strong>. So how can you deliver information that your readers actually want? Lori Halley at Wild Apricot suggests&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2013/09/23/applying-contagious-content-framework-to-non-profit-emails"" target=""_blank"">a helpful framework for writing emails that are powerful, personal, and relevant</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong>. A well-crafted welcome series can be both a time-saver and a great way to build relationships. Win-win! <a href=""http://pfa-blog.com/home/autoresponders-are-a-fundraisers-best-friend/"" target=""_blank"">Soak in some smart thinking on automated emails and a step-by-step on getting started</a> from&nbsp;Vanessa Chase at Philanthropy for All.</li>
<li><strong>Check your work</strong>. Testing is really the best way to find out what works when it comes to your email list, and it's easier than it might sond—<a href=""http://www.smartannualgiving.com/designing-a-simple-test-of-your-email-fundraising-campaign/"" target=""_blank"">Donna Mehr at Smart Annual Giving will walk you through the whys and hows</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make connections</strong>. Email can be a great tool for driving engagement in other channels, as Cassie Bair of mGive Blog illustrates in an interesting post (full of top-notch Duck punnery) about <a href=""http://mblog.mgive.com/blog/bid/332954/mSpiration-Email-and-Mobile-A-Match-Made-in-Heaven"" target=""_blank"">using email to build mobile community</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Embrace your inner techie</strong>. Knowing a little about how emails are built can help you spot new opportunities—like these <a href=""http://whistlingduck.net/blog/a-few-technical-tips-for-improving-email-open-rates-and-engagement/"" target=""_blank"">clever technical tips from Andy Adams over at Whistling Duck Blog</a> (hi, fellow duck!) for upping your engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Build on what you know</strong>. Even if you're new to email marketing, there's a lot you can learn from your past experiences crafting smart communications in other channels. For inspiration, check out <a href=""http://www.thefundraisingauthority.com/internet-fundraising/better-fundraising-emails/"" target=""_blank"">this post from Joe Garecht at The Fundraising Authority</a>&nbsp;on some of the similarities and differences between offline (direct mail) fundraising and email fundraising.</li>
<li><strong>And one more for the road...</strong> It's not about email marketing, strictly speaking, but it's useful to take a step back from time to time and think about how we use email as an internal communications tool. Erik Anderson on Donor Dreams Blog offers some <a href=""http://donordreams.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/youve-got-to-stop-emailing-your-non-profit-board-members-all-the-time/"" target=""_blank"">wise advice for emailing effectively with your board</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you've found some useful tips—I'm looking forward to getting your even-more-excellent emails in my inbox very soon.</p>
<p>Next month's Carnival will be hosted by Claire Axelrad of Clairification, and she's picked a great topic: getting and sustaining major gifts. <a href=""http://www.clairification.com/2013/09/25/october-nonprofit-blog-carnival-call-for-submissions-tricks-or-treats-how-do-you-get-and-sustain-major-gifts/"" target=""_blank"">Check out her call for submissions</a>&nbsp;to learn more, and if you haven't yet, <a href=""http://eepurl.com/tbGNb%20"" target=""_blank"">sign up for email updates when the Carnival goes live</a>.</p>

Sure, growing your list is important, but keeping existing donors and getting those folks to give again is really where most organizations should focus their fundraising communications.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the hallmarks of donor engagement lie not just in how much or how often they give. Donors don’t want to only give from their wallet. They want to volunteer, ask their friends to support you, attend events, and more. To help inspire nonprofit leaders, board members, and community activists, philanthropist Jeff Walker and fund-raising expert Jennifer McCrea have written <i>The Generosity Network: new transformational tools for successful fund-raising</i>. While I have not had a chance to read it yet, I’m intrigued by the five major themes that were recently distilled by Liz Ragland:</p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>1. Know Yourself</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Your personal attitude toward money and giving can impact your ask and how you relate to donors.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>2. Know Others</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Think about your donor-organization-fundraiser dynamic (donors are not walking checkbooks).</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>3. Know How to Ask&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">An ask is just an invitation to invest resources in a cause that matters.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>4. Create your powerful story</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Stories have unique powers that forge connections between people and bring ideas to life.</p>
<p class=""p2""></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>5. Cultivate your relationships&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Make the leap from an exchange of words to an authentic relationship.</p>

But actually, I think the new inbox design will force many nonprofits to become better communicators, and that’s a good thing.</p>","<p>I’ve heard a fair amount of grumbling since Google started rolling out their new Inbox format a few months ago. (If you haven’t switched over or heard about it yet, here’s a <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/29/gmail-for-desktop-and-mobile-gets-a-new-inbox-now-automatically-categorizes-your-email/"">nice overview by Techcrunch</a> that will give you the gist fast.) Some folks don’t want Google telling them how to sort their email, while others are worried they’ll loose something important or, worse, that their important message will get lost in someone else’s inbox.</p>
<p>Odds are good that most emails sent by nonprofits will end up in the ‘promotions’ tab rather than in the ‘primary’ tab. That means a donor will have to deliberately click away from the inbox she spends most of their time managing to spot your year-end appeal emails, enews, or that digital petition you want her to sign. Sounds like a bummer, right?</p>
<p>Actually, I think the new inbox design will force many nonprofits to become better communicators, and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Since your email is now competing, literally side-by-side, with other organization’s messages, you’ll have to craft truly compelling subject lines (no more ‘October 2013 newsletter’ please!). You’ll also have to consistently provide meaningful content to win your reader’s attention and loyalty. Expect it to take a longer for them to read and click through, because they will be less likely to be reviewing their ‘promotions’ tab as frequently as their ‘primary’ tab.</p>
<p>But perhaps there’s also a silver lining. Many of the donors you want to reach are busy people who spend more time than they care to admit triaging their email. Their goal (and, if you admit it, yours too) is to reduce email clutter and reach the Holy Grail: <a href=""http://inboxzero.com/"">Inbox Zero</a>. With Google’s new inbox, your missive can dodge the delete key during a hectic workday and wait patiently for your reader, unnoticed when they are in search-and-destroy mode. Once your reader finds time to visit her ‘promotions’, my bet is that she will be more likely to actually read your attention-grabbing, high-content-delivering email. Let’s hope she’s got her credit card handy, too.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,2059%2,2063%3","Blog | New google inbox for nonprofits","","","big duck blog the new google inbox for nonprofits","services email communications experiential","services email experiential communications","",

Focus on the ""musts.""","Elizabeth Ricca","1049","","<p dir=""ltr"">When you spend your days working for a nonprofit, steeped in the complexity of your issue and the nuances of your approach, it can be almost impossible to boil all of that information up into a few simple ideas that really get your message across.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Here’s a little trick that might help you see the forest in spite of all those trees.</p>","<p dir=""ltr"">Messaging is one of the first and most important tools nonprofit communicators need in their toolkits. Whether you're out to drive donations, inspire actions, attract volunteers, or recruit participants, it all starts with a clear understanding of what story you need to tell and how to tell it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sounds easy enough, doesn’t it? But when you spend your days working for a nonprofit, steeped in the complexity of your issue and the nuances of your approach, it can be almost impossible to boil all of that information up into a few simple ideas that really get your message across.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Here’s a little trick that might help you see the forest in spite of all those trees:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Focus on the “musts.”</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Start by taking a step back, and imagine you're talking to someone who's never heard of your organization before. What are the key points you MUST communicate if you want him to walk away with a basic understanding of (and hopefully a little bit of interest in) what you do? If he forgets almost everything you say, what are the couple of nuggets of information that should stick in his mind?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those key points will vary for every organization, but they might include...</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Quickly explaining the problem you exist to solve—not all of the details, just the big idea (e.g., preserving wildlife is important for the environment, or heart disease is the #1 killer of women)</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Emphasizing that your organization is needed (e.g., we’re the only ones doing this important work, or we have to tackle this disease from every angle if we want to find a cure)</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Communicating that your approach is effective (e.g., we’ve successfully protected dozens of species, or the research we’ve funded is already leading to more effective treatments)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, you might have a longer list depending on how complex your nonprofit’s story is, but the goal is to figure out the bare minimum of what someone needs to understand. In fact, it should probably feel a little uncomfortable—it’s a very reductive way to think about your work. But if you can identify a few quick and memorable “musts” to get the conversation started, you can create opportunities later on to dig into the details and help your audiences gain a more nuanced understanding.</p>

Once you develop that voice, it’s one of the most powerful tools you have to connect with people and leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s challenging for any writer to develop his or her own unique voice and bring it to the page time and time again. (I certainly struggle with that in my own personal, outside-of-work writing projects.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But it’s perhaps even more difficult for organizations to develop their voice, simply because different people are the voice of their nonprofit at different times. And the question is, with so many people speaking on an organization’s behalf, how can you be sure that they’re doing so consistently? How can you be sure that one singular voice comes across in all communications?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are few things more satisfying than hearing a client tell me, “This really sounds like us.” While there isn’t any cut-and-dried formula that makes it any easier to sound like them, there are tools we use at Big Duck—which any nonprofit communicator can use—that are helpful in evaluating the effectiveness and consistency of language.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I usually start writing for an organization not long after we’ve refined their personality—that’s the tone and style that you want to come across in all communications—and keeping that list of traits nearby is a great way to assess whether or not any given piece of writing accomplishes its purpose, reflects the strategy we’ve laid out, and evokes the personality we want it to evoke.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But even then, personality is ultimately subjective in that it means a variety of things to different people and lends itself to diverse interpretations. So even if your website’s headings or your emails align with an established personality, how can you be sure that your organization’s singular voice is coming through loud and clear?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We often develop <a href=""/nice_to_meet_you_audience"">audience personas</a>, fictional profiles of typical members of an organization’s target audiences, which can be helpful in reminding anyone developing communications of any kind that there’s a real person on the other end who’s reading it, and ideally the message should be targeted to that person.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lately, I’ve been wondering if it might be valuable to develop a fictional profile of the person doing the writing. Keeping that profile nearby as you write an email or update your website is a helpful reminder that those messages should sound like they’re coming from a real person—with a unique voice. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Like most generalizations, the only problem with this is that it’s a generalization.</p>
<p>When you write for your website, you need to write for the majority of your visitors. In other words, keep it short. You don’t want to overwhelm your readers, especially if they’re coming to your organization or issue for the first time.</p>
<p>Prioritize. Think about what your site visitors really must know and give it to them as quickly and succinctly as possible.</p>
<p>But don’t forget about the exceptions. Give readers the option for more, when they’re ready for it.</p>
<p>If you deal with a difficult-to-understand medical issue, for example, start with the basics. Once people feel comfortable with that information, gently direct them to another page on the site where they can dive into more specific content more deeply.</p>
<p>Even then, though, don’t assume you can just dump everything you know about your issue into a largely hidden web page. Be ruthless with yourself and your content.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s easy. Many of us struggle with simplifying complex missions or complicated programs. It’s a near universal communications problem.</p>

<p>Because they’re working in the field every day, staff should know better than anyone how their organization’s communications stack up. Often, they’re the first to arrive at the conclusion that a significant change in communications—whether it’s brand-related or not—is in order. But getting others to arrive at that same conclusion can be tough. Here are the three easy ways to jumpstart the conversation:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Materials review.</b>&nbsp;Invite a few key board members to a meeting, put all of your materials out on the table, and talk about them. Explore what’s working, what’s not, and what you’d like to do in the next year. Including board members in that conversation may be the spark that starts the fire you need to get the board’s support.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Landscape review.</b>&nbsp;As part of a board meeting, bring up the websites of three to five peer agencies. As you show the board how your peers communicate online, talk a bit about how your agencies differ, what they do well, what you do better, etc. At the end, bring up your website. Point out how they describe their work and show them how you’re currently communicating, too.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>‘Best practices’ showcase.</b>&nbsp;As part of a board or staff meeting, show websites from three nonprofits who you feel do an excellent job communicating. Try to pick examples that reflect the direction or ideas you feel your organization should be thinking about too. These organizations might be much bigger, smaller, or programmatically different from you—it doesn’t matter. The goal here is to help educate people about what others are doing in a way that encourages them to aspire to do it better at your nonprofit, too.</p>
<p>All three of these ideas rely on the conversation that emerges to help move people toward a new way of considering your communications. Be sure to help that conversation unfold without controlling it too much. Change will be most effectively embraced when everyone sees the need for it themselves, and they’ll resist it if a few vocal people try to drive the conversation in too directed a manner.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Blog Post","blog_post","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1","Blog | Explaining brand benefits to boards","","","big duck blog explaing the benefits of a fresh brand to a traditionalist board","brand strategy board communications professional nonprofit","brand strategy board communications professional nonprofit","",

Pumpkin flavored products are everywhere. Signs that Fall has arrived are all around us, and yes, year-end fundraising season is upon us here at Big Duck.</p>
<p>An effective year-end campaign plan requires a lot of thoughtful planning. What’s the goal? What’s the timeframe? What’s the budget? Who should we reach out to and through what channels? As you think through these questions and others, (check out Farra’s great post “<a href=""/blog-12-ways-to-make-your-multichannel-campaign-stand-out"" target=""_parent"">12 ways to make your multichannel campaign stand out</a>"") here’s another one to throw into the mix—<strong>who’s asking?</strong></p>
<p>Take some time (perhaps with pumpkin spiced latte in hand) to think not just about what you are saying to donors, but who is delivering the message. This includes whose signature is at the end of your direct mail letter, what name is in the “from” field in your emails, and who (if anyone) is calling up past donors to remind them to give. So whether you’re working in house or bringing in outside expertise, here’s a few things to consider when selecting the voice (or voices) of your year-end fundraising campaign.</p>
<p><strong>1. Learn from the past.</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, a nonprofit’s executive director, director of development, or board president signs off on fundraising letters and emails. After all, they can usually speak most directly to the organization’s need for financial support. Dive into your archives for a refresher as to who has been the voice of your end of year campaign in the past. Have your appeals been signed from the same person every year?</p>
<p><strong>2. Walk in your donors’ shoes.</strong></p>
<p>As you plan out your fundraising campaign, remember to think like your donors think. Which representative from your organization have you found is most appealing to your donors? Who do you expect they will most likely respond to and why?</p>
<p><strong>3. Match the message with the messenger.</strong></p>
<p>Even your donors who already love what you do are still going to need to be reminded to give - and it helps if there’s some urgency backing up the ask. What do you need to say to donors this year to convince them to donate, and who is best suited to deliver that message?</p>
<p><strong>4. Consider a series of voices.</strong></p>
<p>No matter how articulate, one person can never tell the full story of your organization. A well crafted email series that features a mix of stories can be a great tool to demonstrate the breadth of your work. For example, one email can be signed from your executive director who speaks about this year’s biggest challenges, the next from a program participant whose life was changed by your work, and another from a committed donor who can share why she chooses to give. Together, their voices can tell a more holistic story about your organization.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make it feel real.</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of who is making the ask, the letter or email should feel true to the voice of the sender. So if you’re signing an email from the perspective of a major donor, be sure that the writing captures that person’s real personality. Try including your storyteller in the editing process in some form or another to ensure that her voice is accurately represented.</p>
<p><strong>6. When in doubt, test.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re not sure this time around whose voice will most resonate with your donors, try some basic email testing. If you’re planning an email series that has two or more senders, for example, take a look at which email had the higher open and response rates after the results are in.</p>

<p class=""p1"">What about fundraising? Well just a week or two after the event, I received an engaging text from the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Using a simple quiz question, IRC quickly taught me about their work and one of their programs in less than a minute.</p>

As a result, it feels like information and conversation ebbs and flows more organically between nonprofit leaders, staff, activists, donors, clients, and interested bystanders.</p>
<p>As I watch conversations unfold in places like Twitter, I often find myself thinking about the people behind the obtuse or organizational Twitter handle. Who are they? What’s their role?</p>
<p>In some nonprofits, the way a staff person’s bio is shared really helps clarify their point of view on a topic. It can also help make the inaccessible more accessible (check out <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarackObama"" target=""_parent"">@BarackObama</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/FLOTUS"" target=""_parent"">@flotus</a> on Twitter!), and make you feel connected to founders, visionaries, and change-agents worldwide.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about your staff’s personality on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media. The way you share who they are on your website counts too- and can be important to help a donor, client, or peer reach the right person. Our pals over at <a href=""http://www.nonprofithub.org/"" target=""_parent"">Nonprofit Hub</a> wrote a nice piece recently called <a href=""http://www.nonprofithub.org/nonprofit-marketing-plan/7-steps-to-compelling-staff-bios-on-your-nonprofit-website/"">7 Steps to Compelling Staff Bios on our Nonprofit Website</a> that’s a useful read on this subject: check it out.</p>

Where should you focus your efforts? How can you be sure your message reaches the right people? And how do you manage all this without wasting a big chunk of time?<br /> <br /> Here’s three quick tips that can help make sure your social media efforts stay on target:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt"">Feel free to experiment with different social networks, but don’t feel obligated to be active on every platform.</h3>
New networks appear all the time, but most don’t stick around long or gain enough users to be much of a benefit to your organization. Remember Eons or Diaspora? Of course you don’t. They cropped up as The Next Big Thing and fell off everyone’s radar in practically the same month.</li>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt"">Know where your supporters hangout online and target them there.</h3>
This social media tip follows simple logic—if your audience isn’t there, then it’s a waste. Twitter could be a great investment if you’re trying to reach technology savvy teenagers and young adults, but significantly less so if retirees make up your core audience. Find out what your supporters do online before you become too invested in a particular method or outlet.</li>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt"">Figure out the best time of day to post and show off your most important content then.</h3>
People have patterns. Some like to check out their social networks before getting out of bed while others spend their lunch hour catching up on Facebook posts, and yet others save their internet time for after work. Experiment with posting content at different times and look for patterns. If you find a certain time gets you more likes and retweets, then keep aiming for that sweet spot.</li>

I’m convinced culture is a huge part of it.</p>","<p>More and more, there’s buzz about the internal, political dynamics within organizations of all types, and how it shapes success. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/business/neil-blumenthal-of-warby-parker-on-a-culture-of-communication.html?_r=0"">This recent article in the New York Times</a> interviewing Warby Parker CEO Neil Blumenthal talks about the importance of integrating values into the workplace, creating forums for sharing, and developing a culture of candor, for instance.</p>
<p>Why do some nonprofits (and for-profits) have brands that feel really dimensional and alive, while others might look good or sound good, but perhaps it rings a bit flat? I’m convinced culture is a huge part of it.</p>
<p>Branding shouldn’t be make up- and it should never be ‘putting lipstick on a pig’, as the saying goes. Your nonprofit’s brand strategy, messaging, and visual identity should be an honest articulation of the organization inside and out.</p>
<p>For years, we Ducks have been observing the impact of corporate culture on the nonprofits we work with. We’ve even developed ways to integrate culture, politics, and buy-in into our brandraising process, so organizations have a better shot at success.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in what we’ve uncovered, I’ll be giving a workshop twice this fall called “The Beliefs Behind your Brand”, once in <a href=""/national-philanthropy-day-ct-beliefs-behind-your-brand"">Connecticut on November 15</a>, and again at <a href=""/nov-21-bagels-beliefs-behind-your-brand"">Big Duck’s Brooklyn office on November 21</a>.

Women are the backbone of the social sector! They lead organizations, run departments, and power nonprofits at all levels. In fact, women make up 2/3rds of the nonprofit workforce, yet despite that, we still occupy only 18.8% of the leadership slots at the top 400 charities. Sigh.&nbsp;</p>","<p class=""p1"">For years, I’ve noticed that the majority of faces you see in most nonprofits belong to women. Women are the backbone of the social sector! They lead organizations, run departments, and power nonprofits at all levels. In fact, women <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/A-Mans-World/57099/"" target=""_parent"">make up 2/3 of the nonprofit workforce</a>, yet despite that, we still occupy only <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/section/Philanthropy-400/237/"" target=""_parent"">18.8% of the leadership slots at the top 400 charities</a>. Sigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">But perhaps times are changing.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Some of the most interesting conversations I had in 2013 were sparked by Sheryl Sandberg’s book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947"" target=""_parent""><em>Lean In</em></a>. Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that Sandberg’s book is full of lessons in professional leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">I got together with my friends Stephanie Thomas, who chairs the Association of Fundraising Professional (AFP)’s New York Chapter,&nbsp; and Adrienne Prassas, a fundraiser <i>par excellence</i> who currently works for the American Heart Association to convene a pop-up event for AFP NY members about women’s leadership in fundraising on November 14, 2013. About 30 women in fundraising participated, representing a mix of age, race, and professional experience. Here are a few highlights from our discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><b>Volunteering is a great way to develop your leadership skills.</b> Want to transition into a career in international development? Build your skills in planned giving? Overcome your shyness at speaking in front of groups? Volunteer! Organizing or staffing an event, coordinating a committee, and other volunteer activities not only open up networks, they force you to work with new people in new situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><b>Tell them what you need to learn.</b> Trying to break into a new area? Develop new skills? Tell your boss or your peers and colleagues what you want to learn, and offer to help out with projects that may be outside of your job description so you can build your skills. For instance, if you’re a grant writer but you want to get into major donor work, ask your boss if you can help them research and prep for a meeting, or listen in on a meeting or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><b>Be yourself.</b> We talked a lot about the power of authenticity in building a strong reputation. Not sure what the answer is? Be honest about it. It’s good to stretch- but it’s not good to be something you’re not. Most of the experienced women at this event found their careers really took off when they spoke with their own voice, rather than trying to play a part they felt was expected of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><b>Show up.</b> It’s easy to watch that webinar from your desk, follow along via social media in your jammies from home, and learn virtually. But when you show up at a conference, breakfast, workshop, or other event, the benefits are much greater. Get out and show up! You’ll make deeper, more meaningful connections faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Personally, I was deeply inspired by the younger women who participated, like Amalyah Oren, a young woman who works at the <a href=""http://www.thesbf.org/"">Samuel Bronfman Foundation</a> by day, runs a <a href=""http://fosterdogsnyc.com/"">dog rescue and fostering group</a> by night, and writes a blog called the <a href=""http://thegivingkind.wordpress.com/"">Giving Kind</a>. She posted <a href=""http://thegivingkind.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/empowerment-at-a-pop-up/"">a great piece about the event</a>, too. If these are tomorrow’s leaders, I can’t wait to see them occupy those leadership seats!&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1,1406%2","Blog | Women's leadership in fundraising","","","lean in womens leadership fundraising development sheryl sandberg","fundraising women","fundraising women leaning in ","",

So how do you reach your supporters and get them to do more than “like” your page? Read the recap, view the slides, and watch the video from a recent event about Facebook marketing for nonprofits.</p>","<p>Facebook: it’s a small social network you may have heard about… yes? Since its roll-out to individuals beyond college campuses and high schools in 2006, and then to businesses and organizations in 2007, Facebook has become a formidable communications channel for all—including nonprofits. With over one billion active users, there’s a good chance some or all of your community lives there. So how do you reach your supporters and get them to do more than “like” your page? The trick is good content. In fact, one of my favorite tips was that nonprofits should aim to create content that “educates, entertains, and raises your brand awareness.”</p>
<p>As a co-organizer of 501 Tech NYC, a local meetup for NTEN members and their friends, I asked Kaiya Waddell, client partner at Facebook, and Amy Bryant, managing editor of Planned Parenthood Online, to share their insights and examples. <strong>You can view their slides, watch the video, and dig through a rocking recap further down in this post.</strong> I also wanted to share some resources our wonderful speakers shared after the event (and a few of my own):</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Get support from Facebook: There are two ways that most nonprofits can obtain support: <a target=""_parent"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/facebookforbusiness/contact-us"">through this form</a> and through the support form located in Ads Manager. Any advertiser who has spent money in the previous 28 days should see a link on the left hand side of their <a target=""_parent"" href=""http://www.facebook.com/ads/manage"">Ads Manager</a> that reads ""Email Support.”</li>
<li>When posting text on images, nonprofits should strive to make their content compliant with Facebook’s <a target=""_parent"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/468870969814641?sr=2&amp;sid=0wHgulajEEPc0L7GN"">text overlay policy</a>. This content will perform better and will be ""ad ready"" in case you decide to promote the post. To confirm whether the content is compliant with the policy, <a target=""_parent"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay"">you can use this tool</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to reach your community that’s on Facebook with advertising, try <a target=""_parent"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/459892990722543"">Custom Audiences</a>. Custom Audiences is a way for nonprofits to take their CRM data (email list, donors, etc.) and match them to Facebook for targeting. Kaiya recommends you different Custom Audiences that are reflective of different types of high value segments. For example: Audience 1= lapsed email openers, Audience 2 = low dollar donors, Audience 3 = Online activists that you want to re-engage, and so on.</li>
<li>You can also experiment with prospecting on Facebook using “Lookalike Audiences.” Lookalike Audiences are created from a Custom Audience, and allow you to find more people who LOOK LIKE my audience.</li>
<li>Your nonprofit should try get in the News Feed as much as possible. To help do this and drive meaningful offsite conversions, Kaiya recommends that you use “Link Page Posts” as your ad unit. To create Unpublished Link Page Posts (i.e. those that are not published live to the Facebook page, but are simply ads) should go to: <a target=""_parent"" href=""http://www.facebook.com/ads/create"">www.facebook.com/ads/create</a> and select ""Website conversions"" as your objective. That process will walk you through creating a conversion pixel (which will track website conversions in Facebook) and also set up your Link Page Post ad.</li>
<li>Looking to better track what’s happening on your page? Here are <a target=""_parent"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/383440231709427/"">more details on Page Insights</a> —the analytics Facebook provides to all Page admins.</li>

(Like, deep. I may be the last person on earth who enjoys being called ma'am.) So, not many things tickle me more than seeing so many of our nonprofit peers sending out such creative and genuine letters of thanks this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(My favorite so far, The Wildlife Conservation Society's email that's basically written via embedded GIFs of cute animals. Yawww... who could resist?)</p>
<p>From&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lzh2Sk1jFI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/about/you-are-a-hero-for-animals.html?credit=em_yenat112513"" target=""_blank"">infographics</a>, to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mercycorps.org/photos/zimbabwe/thank-you-harare"" target=""_blank"">a simple letter</a>&nbsp;I've seen nonprofits say thank you in a lot of different ways over the past few years. (Huzzah for your creativity, folks!)</p>
<p>But no matter the level of sophistication, it's a few things that really make the thank you's I love stand out...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>They're sincere.</b>&nbsp;I know, duh, of course they should be sincere. But in fairness, it's all too easy to phone it in on a message that doesn't ask for something concrete. The thank you's I love most though, are rooted in good, personal writing. They are not written in some faceless organizational ""we"" -- they showcase your personality, your voice, and the little quirks and anecdotes that make you or your organization real. Expressing that uniqueness in a concise but authentic way is not easy, it takes attention and guts.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>They give me a sense of the big picture.</b>&nbsp;Before we get to the actual thanking -- Thanksgiving calls us to lift our heads up above the daily grind and take stock. In the same way, I love thank you messages that give me a quick assessment of how their work is doing that year. Like a more interesting annual report wrapped up in a big thank you hug. This can be accomplished by something as simple (but cool!) as the top five victories Earthjustice's supporters made possible, to something as involved as the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/about/you-are-a-hero-for-animals.html?credit=em_yenat112513"" target=""_blank"">Humane Society's nifty and interactive infographic</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>They're creative AND relevant.</b>&nbsp;Sure, creativity for the sake of creativity is neat. But the really good stuff is when you're creative in a way that seems entirely relevant to your community. A great example of this is Fountain House. Thanksgiving is their biggest celebration of the year, an evening when staff and members have dinner together. So every year they send supporters who can't be there a blank placemat where they can write a note of support to a member, and send it back in to be placed on the Thanksgiving table.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>They're not JUST an excuse to ask for more.</b>&nbsp;As someone who identifies as a fundraiser, I'm definitely not against asking for gifts. However, the best fundraising is about relationships, and relationships are about a balance of giving and taking. This is the time for giving (ok maybe with a soft ""ask"" at the end). Messages that start out as thank yous but become quickly self-serving (""thank you for thinking we're so great, hey want to give us a gift?""), never ring as true as thank you's that focus on the reader and your shared values and victories.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>They showcase the ones you serve.</b>&nbsp;As a supporter, I like to be thanked, but I also love to see that any organization truly values and celebrates the ones they serve. The USO did a lovely job of this this year, not only thanking me for my help, but also giving me a way to send a thank you of my own to the troops through their&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uso.org/thanks/?src=WW13TFEE02&amp;utm_source=WW13TFEE02&amp;utm_campaign=1311_TFE&amp;sc=WW13TFEE02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;ta=0"" target=""_blank"">Thanks from everywhere action</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>All in all, I've been pretty impressed with what I've seen this year so far. So, here's my own big thank you to all the organizations who are pushing themselves to thank their communities in authentic and creative ways. Y'all are keeping me inspired to keep it real in my own storytelling.</p>

<p>You turn to them confidently and make a case for support that moves them to tears. They write a check. Better yet: your new donor stays connected. She reads your newsletter, shows up at events, and continues to make gifts over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of elements that have to come together to make a scenario like that actually happen, but one of them shouldn’t be that you don’t know how to make a case for support.</p>

<p>In less than 200 pages, Ahern defines what a case is, how to use one, and how to craft one in five clear, simple steps. The book is chock full of examples and is so easy to read I bet you can get through it in one or two sittings. It blends some basic fundraising ‘best practices’ with good copywriting techniques like avoiding jargon, or speaking about benefits rather than features.</p>

<p>This move by Facebook <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/01/facebook-gifts-get-charitable-you-can-now-give-the-gift-of-donations-to-your-friends/"" target=""_parent"">builds on its Gifts program</a> from last year, which never really seemed to take off beyond the initial nonprofit partners, and its more recent push to encourage Facebook users to support the Red Cross’ Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts. When studies like the Nonprofit Social Networking Benchmark Report find <a href=""http://www.frogloop.com/care2blog/2013/10/30/can-nonprofits-raise-money-on-social-media.html"" target=""_parent"">that the majority of nonprofits have raised less than $10,000 through social media</a>, this news seems like it could make a big difference.</p>

<p>What’s great about this news is that 100% of the funds donated will go to the nonprofit and giving will show up where many of your supporters are spending their time. But (and there’s always a but!) the news isn’t all good. Here are some concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>User data (donor’s name, address, etc.) will not be shared with the nonprofit. Facebook is still a platform that values its individual users first. Unless you catch a supporter commenting or sharing the news of their gift, Sohini Baliga points out that <a href=""http://sohini.com/social-media/facebook-launches-donate-button-for-non-profits/"" target=""_parent"">your organization will not be able to thank and cultivate the donor.</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Speaking of data, when you donate, CNET reports “<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57615757-93/facebooks-donate-button-helps-nonprofits-and-facebook/"" target=""_parent"">your information will go into Facebook’s database of members with credit cards attached to their accounts.</a>”</li>
<li><a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/12/16/facebook-donate-non-profits/"" target=""_parent"">Giving can only be done via Facebook’s website</a>. Mashable reported that, “There is no set timetable for its available on mobile, but a Facebook spokesperson called mobile integration a ‘priority’.""</li>
</ul>
<p>My fellow nonprofiteers seem to range from skeptical to intrigued by the “Donate Now” addition to Facebook. Others wish <a href=""http://mediacause.org/why-facebook-must-launch-facebookadgrants-for-nonprofits/"" target=""_parent"">Facebook would provide an advertising grants program</a>, similar to Google (<a href=""http://www.change.org/petitions/facebook-save-nonprofits-from-being-silenced-with-facebookadgrants"" target=""_parent"">you can sign a petition to support that here</a>). If you are on the fence, you can also explore creating a donation page within Facebook that connects to your CRM or database and even offers a link to your website, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/humanesociety/app_451269074979161"" target=""_parent"">following this great example by The Humane Society of the United States.</a></p>

<p>Since it’s time to say thanks to your donors for the support they offered you through year-end or other gifts, I thought I’d share a few fabulous ways nonprofits have said thanks in unexpected ways to inspire you.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I found this <a href=""http://vimeo.com/59558659"">video Charity:water made on Valentine’s Day to thank their donors.</a> Having staff make Valentine’s cards for donors? Love that.</p>
<p><a href=""/rebecca-goldsmith"">Rebecca Goldsmith</a>, our communications coordinator, flagged two examples she really likes of nonprofits saying thanks. This one’s a <a href=""http://youtu.be/VF-1vqMslBc"">video with more international and programmatic content from the Nature Conservancy</a>. It’s a bigger budget production, but it really helps you see what you’ve invested in.&nbsp; Rebecca also spotted a great email (<a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/plannedparenthood/5-reasons-womens-health-supporters-had-a-great-20-dadi"">posted here via BuzzFeed)</a> that Planned Parenthood sent out featuring a series of excellent animated GIFs. Cheap and easy, this message is delivered with humor but emphasizing serious progress in their work, which donors love to see.</p>
<p>Lastly, in case you missed it, Big Duck’s senior strategist <a href=""/rachel-hope-allison"">Rachel Allison</a> recently blogged about what makes a great thank you,<a href=""/great-donor-thank-yous"">&nbsp;well, great.</a></p>
<p>Got a favorite way to say thanks? Keep us posted, please.</p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of New Year’s resolutions, but I am a big fan of taking a step back and reflecting. So when the<a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/What-Nonprofits-Should-Stop/143701/""> Chronicle of Philanthropy asked us what Nonprofits should stop doing in 2014</a>, I couldn’t help but start thinking about what’s different this year.</p>
<p>In truth, nonprofits are so varied in size and capacity that I often feel it’s unreasonable to make one-size-fits-all, sector-wide recommendations. I won’t even go there. But if you’re thinking about the <a href=""/why-big-rocks-rock"" target=""_blank"">big rocks</a> you’ll try to tackle in 2014, here are a few things I hope you won’t ignore.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Don’t put lipstick on a pig.&nbsp; </b>No functional strategic plan in place?<b> </b>Staff working in silos? Internal systems and technologies a mess? Want to kill your colleagues? Get your internal house in order before you spend time or money on big external projects or new initiatives in 2014. More and more, we Ducks find that fixing what’s broken inside is a critical first step toward raising more money, increasing awareness, and other goals traditionally considered ‘external’.</li>
<li><b>Plan to communicate better in 2014.</b> If your internal house is in order, this is the perfect time of year to review your communications calendar and plan the year ahead. Don’t just consider what each department wants to send out; think about your organization’s voice, overarching goals, and the story you want to tell. Having a <a href=""/big-duck-blog-how-to-be-more-strategic-with-your-content"" target=""_blank"">content strategy in place will help get you started, as will this article</a>.</li>
<li><b>Keep an eye on Facebook.</b> Facebook has recently made a lot of changes that affect nonprofits. &nbsp;<a href=""/farra-trompeter"" target=""_blank"">Farra Trompeter</a>, Big Duck’s Vice President, wrote two must-read articles on the subject: “<a href=""/big-duck-blog-how-to-use-facebook-to-market-your-nonprofit"" target=""_blank"">Facebook for nonprofits: moving your marketing beyond the ‘like’</a>”, and “<a href=""/big-duck-blog-using-facebook-as-a-fundraising-tool"" target=""_blank"">Maybe you can raise money on Facebook after all…</a>”, which explains Facebook’s new ability to accept donations. In 2014, keeping an eye on <a href=""https://blog.facebook.com/"" target=""_parent"">Facebook’s blog</a> might also help your organization decide if changes warrant a lighter or deeper investment.</li>

<p>Need inspiration? Last month, <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/What-Nonprofits-Should-Start/143699/"" target=""_parent"">the Chronicle of Philanthropy asked me and some other nonprofiteers what we thought nonprofits should <i>start</i> doing in 2014</a>. I pushed a message of better donor engagement and communications consistency, while others talked about smarter use of data, diving into social fundraising, sharing results more, and connecting generations of volunteers.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">Instead of putting so much time and energy into winning new donors, charities need to do a better job getting gifts from the supporters they already have, says Farra Trompeter, vice president of Big Duck, a communications-consulting company that works with nonprofits.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">She recommends that nonprofits start by reviewing exactly what happens after someone makes a first gift to determine areas that need improvement. Organizations should then seek to personalize the way they thank donors and better report on the impact of their gifts.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">The goal, says Ms. Trompeter, is for donors to think, “Wow, I feel part of this organization. I’m not just this random person that’s disconnected and the organization just sees me as a credit card or a checkbook. They see me as a partner.”</p>
<p>Take a few minutes today to read the rest of the article, and use it to inspire a conversation with your fellow nonprofiteers. Pick your one thing, write it on a post-it, and stick it somewhere you look everyday.</p>

<p>As usual, in compiling this list (special shout-out to all my lovely colleagues and their opinions on words), a lot of overused jargon that holds very little meaning (ugh) popped up as what we Ducks consider the less appealing language to choose from. Of course, I fully recognize that overly technical insider speak can serve a purpose—like demonstrating your expertise or leadership within a given field. Still, the English language is rich with possibilities, and I truly believe that anyone can talk the talk without using any of the following words.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here is Big Duck's 2014 list of words to avoid.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Performance/outcome/process-driven/based/oriented</h3>
<p>It isn't just that all of these phrases are completely overused in the nonprofit world (which, believe you me, they most definitely are). It's also that none of them really means much of anything—you could pair any of those nouns with any of those adjectives and it wouldn't make a difference—or paints a clearer picture of your work to your audiences. And when a word or phrase holds little meaning but is also used to the point of oblivion, it's probably time to (attempt to) retire it.</p>
<p>So to all you outcome-oriented nonprofiteers who manage performance-driven programs at process-based organizations, first of all, you're not alone, and second of all, what do you actually mean—what are you actually getting at?—when you use those phrases? Can you imagine how much more compelling you'd sound to people outside your inner circle by translating that jargon into something accessible and likelier to strike an emotional chord?</p>
<p>One more note about this cluster of words to avoid: What's more important than being performance-driven, outcome-based, or process-oriented? Probably the performances, outcomes, and process themselves, no? If those things are truly distinguishing enough to warrant using all the related phrases that tend to come along with them, why not just cut to a direct description of your results or processes? Otherwise, anything ""performance-driven"" doesn't really have much of a place in your communications.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Value-Add</h3>
<p>Vomit-add.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Any verb as a noun</h3>
<p>Not all jargon consists of weird verb-as-noun constructions, but nearly all weird verb-as-noun constructions are exactly the sort of workplace jargon we should do our part to avoid: ""The takeaway from today's webinar."" ""Time to focus on the build."" ""What was the ask?""</p>
<p>If you can stomach some additional reading about all the ew, check out <a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/those-irritating-verbs-as-nouns/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"">this New York <em>Times</em> opinion piece</a>, a good read that your inner linguist can nerd out on. Just be aware of the fact that you'll probably become ten times more aware of everyone around you using verbs as nouns after reading it. I know I sure did.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Hashtag</h3>
<p>Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake pretty much make the case against using ""hashtag,"" or any other word that only holds formal meaning when texted or tweeted, in common parlance with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA"">this video</a>, which shows just how utterly annoying this recent phenomenon is. By the way, saying ""OMG"" or ""selfie"" in everyday conversations is equally deplorable. Also, even on Facebook or Twitter, where hashtags actually have a functional purpose, they should still be used with caution. #srsly #notevenkidding</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Twittersphere</h3>
<p>Or any other not-really-a-sphere sphere for that matter. (Blogosphere, I'm looking at you.)</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Viral</h3>
<p>Okay, let's just get this out of the way: creating something that'll go ""viral"" isn't really a great goal for your communications. When people share things, it's because those things are worth sharing. And beyond that, have we all lost sight of the original meaning of the word viral? Is something related to infections that attack our immune systems <em>really</em> worth striving for?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Twerk</h3>
<p>Okay, I know this one isn't really nonprofit-related, but I'd like to use this opportunity to make a plea to all of today's youth who frequent the Big Duck blog: please give the twerking a rest already! You must have something better to do,<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yolo""> like live only once.</a></p>

In a few (rare) cases I’ve even heard stories about rebrands that set an organization back-- usually by alienating donors, clients, staff people.</p>","<p>Rebranding processes can be miraculously transformative or deeply unproductive; I’ve seen several examples of both. In a few (rare) cases I’ve even heard stories about rebrands that set an organization back-- usually by alienating donors, clients, staff people. Perhaps the worst story I’ve heard was shared by a participant in a workshop I gave years ago: her organization had changed its name, logo, and tagline abruptly, losing most of its donors and clients. The rebranding had alienated them by leaving them out of the process, changing something that wasn’t broken, and failing to explain any of the reasons why they did it.</p>
<p>Of course, every nonprofit wants their rebrand to happen as quickly, painlessly, and inexpensively as possible. They want the work to be excellent, and to have it stick, delivering the results the organization aspired to achieve up front.</p>
<p>In truth, rebranding is very much like renovating your home--while you and your large family are living in it. Sometimes, doing it right can mean it takes longer, costs more, and is more messy or disruptive than you might have imagined.</p>
<p>Because Big Duck takes nonprofits through rebranding processes all the time, we’re always looking out for ways to avoid disaster and ensure success for our clients.</p>
<p>Here are three of the key ingredients we’ve noticed exist at the nonprofits that sail through the process largely unscathed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>They have one smart, well-liked, empowered staff person leading the process internally.</b></h3>
Whether you work with outside experts or not, someone on staff has to help coordinate, facilitate, and help staff make decisions. A well-respected Communications Director, Development Director, or Excecutive Director is usually the best person to play this role because they are already respected for their seniority and leadership, which will come in handy. Depending on who’s doing the work with you, it’s less important that they are experienced with branding and more important that they understand how to move a project forward, get decisions made, and do so with buy-in and support from the right people.</li>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>They prioritize doing the work right--not a deadline--to move things forward.</b></h3>
Rather than rushing to get through a rebrand in time for a big event or busy time of year, they let the process dictate the timing. In the end, the time for reflection that this allows for usually proves valuable. It gives people a chance to ‘sleep on it’, which helps them feel comfortable with the change to come.</li>
<li>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>They think carefully about who, how, and when stakeholders are involved. </b></h3>
Where is the staff involved? Where is the board involved? Should we do research into how our clients or members’ perceptions? Should we find out what our peers think? What materials should we test? The ‘right’ answer to these questions varies from nonprofit to nonprofit. Sure, there are ‘best practices’, but budgets, culture, and tolerance for process vary enormously. The organizations that suffer less are able to involve their key stakeholders and do the necessary research at the right moments. That’s trickier than it sounds: for some organizations, that means forming a working committee who’s involved in everything, and a long process. For others, it’s a low-touch approach with only a few people involved at key decision-making moments, relying heavily on individual’s expertise.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>If your organization is going to be rebranding any time soon, you might benefit from participating in some (or all!) of a webinar series I’ll be doing through the Foundation Center in February. The Series is called <a href=""http://marketplace.foundationcenter.org/Training/Webinars/Managing-the-Brandraising-Process-4-Part-Webinar-Series"" target=""_blank"">“Managing the Brandraising Process Like&nbsp; Pro”.</a> You can also find out more about each webinar, plus the all-day brandraising workshop I’ll be leading here at Big Duck, on <a href=""/nonprofit_training"" target=""_blank"">our workshops page.</a></p>

One of our talented art directors, Rebecca Hume, subsequently created this information visualization to show us how they stacked up.</p>
<p>Until recently, the term ‘information visualization’ was mostly used by design cognoscenti (sort of like how grammar nerds like to talk about the ‘Oxford comma’).&nbsp; In case you’re still not sure what it means, information visualization is about taking data–the type of stuff you make pie charts and bar graphs out of–and creating more illustrative, engaging visuals that more engagingly make a point.</p>
<p>Creating an effective infographic, as they are also sometimes called, is hard work. You need someone with both the ability to analyze and understand data, and the skill to design something clear and elegant. They are also an excellent way for nonprofits to show their work in action. But how to get them produced without spending a fortune?</p>
<p>In the <a href=""http://hbr.org/2013/10/visualizing-trouble"">October 2013 issue of the Harvard Business Review, author Scott Berinato’s piece “Visualizing Trouble”</a> talks about how hard it is to do well, especially if you’re using some of the more recent free/cheap tech tools that now exist. More importantly, he cites a series of great books that will help the designers you work with get up to speed on how to do this highly specialized type of work better. It’s a must-read if information visualization creation (wow! Three ‘ion’ words in a row!) is on your to-do list for 2014.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1415%2,1410%3","Blog | Information Visualizations","","","big duck blog information visualizations kicking up your game","infographics visuals creative design ","infographics visuals creative design art brandraising brand strategy","",

<p>Finding ways for your nonprofit to better communicate with your supporters will never go out of style—or be an activity you limit to one time of year. So while you may still be feeling the buzz of the new year, here are four activities you can dig into:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Revisit your ask.</strong>&nbsp;Tom Ahern suggests you try questioning what the world would lose if your nonprofit were to disappear tomorrow. As you have the list of what makes you valuable, go back and see how much of that appears in the appeals you send. Take a look at Big Duck president <a href=""/big-duck-blog-how-to-make-your-nonprofit-stand-out%20"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Durham’s thoughts on crafting your case for support</a>&nbsp;as you try to see the world through your donor’s eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Chart out your moments of communication—and seize them as opportunities to connect.</strong>&nbsp;Rachel Hope Allison, senior strategist, breaks down the <a href=""/5_steps_on_your_ladder_of_engagement%20"" target=""_blank"">ladder of engagement along five steps</a> and gives you simple suggestions you can put into action now. From first getting them to join your list to getting them to give more, get creative with the tools you already have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Divide and conquer.</strong> You don’t have the time to contact every single person on your list, but you can easily <a href=""/are-you-ready-to-segment"" target=""_blank"">use segmentation to provide a more personalized experience</a>. Director of Strategy, Elizabeth Ricca, walks you through different ways you can segment your emails and your asks. Take the time to do this now, before your next major fundraising campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Dive into the future and put some social in your fundraising.</strong> Your donors want to ask their friends to give to you too. A few months ago I spoke at the Blackbaud Conference about the future of fundraising from the crowd. Watch the 18-minute video to learn all about social fundraising&nbsp;with data, case studies, and actions you can take.&nbsp;</p>

After all, I am a Project Manager at a communications firm.</p>","<p>It&nbsp;probably comes as no surprise that I care about communicating well. After all, I am a Project Manager at a communications firm.</p>
<p>I don’t just mean sending a powerful message through a bold visual identity or having a singular voice that shines in all of your materials (though I care a great deal about all that too!)—I mean how you communicate internally on a day-to-day basis, with your colleagues, partners, board members, and any other person who plays a key role in your work.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at Big Duck, I’ve seen again and again how strong communication at every stage of a project is essential to the success of a campaign or rebranding effort. We happen to have the pleasure, and benefit, of working with some amazing clients whose openness, directness, and sensitivity to tight timelines have taught us a thing or two (or three) about good communication. Here are the biggest lessons the others Ducks and I have picked up from our clients.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1. There’s no such thing as a stupid question.</h3>
<p>You don’t have to put on a perfect, professional, or even distant front to come across as smart. Some of the most successful collaborations I’ve been part of as a Project Manager have emerged because of a client’s honesty about their inexperience in a specific area or their willingness to ask a question about something they’ve found confusing. I don’t think they are unqualified or too new to be respected. On the contrary, I think they are brilliant, and fantastic allies to work with.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. Don’t be afraid to disagree.</h3>
<p>For the longest time, I thought disagreeing meant sharing bad news, but some of my favorite clients have made me realize that it’s an inevitable part of working with others toward a shared goal. In fact, it’s usually an indicator of a meaningful, mutually beneficial partnership. Every person has a unique and valuable perspective to bring, and sharing that perspective openly and honestly matters, even if it means disagreeing. Our clients have taught me that you can be clear and upfront about what you want or need without being mean, confrontational, or disrespectful. Really, don’t be afraid to say no.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3. Keep people posted.</h3>
<p>It takes about ten seconds to write and send an email that says, “Okay, I’m looking into it” or, “I’ll need a day to get back to you”, and it prevents a ton of headaches and frustration—especially when timing is tight. With campaigns specifically, which can be quite speedy and full of different moving pieces, good communication and timely communication are often one and the same. It’s when I’m waiting on someone else for something and someone I’m working with is waiting on a different someone else for a different something that I’ve most appreciated a well-timed status update. And now, on days when everything is flying, I try to be proactive about keeping my colleagues and clients in the loop.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1405%2","Blog | Lessons we've learned from our clients","","","big duck blog lessons we have learned from our clients","communication campaigns internal staff","clients communication questions lessons bigduck technology email staff staffing inernal","<p>Image from clusternote</p>",

<p>People are invited to join nonprofit boards for all sorts of reasons. Maybe they have useful professional skills, they’re connected politically or socially, or they give regularly, for instance. And being asked to serve on a board is an honor: it means someone believes that you’ll make a meaningful contribution, and that you can handle the responsibilities of governance.</p>

<p>Kay Sprinkel Grace has written many great books on governance, and she certainly knows her stuff. This book is a basic primer designed to cover a lot of ground fast and high-level.&nbsp; It really does take about an hour to read, which means it can’t go too deep into any particular topic. Chapters on working with staff, development and fundraising, and meetings are perhaps most useful.</p>
<p>I’d suggest you send a copy of this book to vetted board candidates to review before they accept an offer to join your board. It will open up an opportunity to have frank conversations about what you will expect of them, and give them a chance to ask questions they may otherwise be embarrassed to ask (like what their legal responsibilities are, for instance).</p>

But sometimes it’s easy to forget what that means outside the context of strategizing and direct mailing and Tweeting. For us Ducks, living our brand entails a commitment to supporting local businesses, office camaraderie, Brooklyn pride, and a real appreciation for, well, having fun. This past Friday, we lived our brand in a totally wonderful way: we had a local beer blind taste-test.</p>
<p>Big Duck loves a good food challenge. We’ve <a href=""/in_pursuit_of_pickle_perfection"" target=""_blank"">pitted deli pickles against farmers market spears</a>, <a href=""/ducks-go-nuts"" target=""_blank"">crunchy peanut butter against smooth</a>, homemade chocolate chip cookies against store-bought Chips-a-hoy. Beer seemed like the logical next step.</p>
<p>The rules were simple: bring in a beer or cider made in New York state and rate the resulting seven beers—all poured into identical plastic cups—according to three categories (Appearance, Refreshment Factor, and Flavor).</p>
<p>We had Schmaltz Coney Island Sword Swallower IPA (Clifton Park, NY), Ithaca Flower Power IPA (Ithaca, NY), Sixpoint Sweet Action (Brooklyn, NY), Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold (Elmsford, NY), Blue Point Toasted Lager (Patchogue, NY), Ommegang White Wheat Ale (Cooperstown, NY), and Evil Twin Imperial Biscotti Break (okay, this beer is from Denmark, but we needed some variety). As our conference room started to smell more and more like a fraternity, and as more and more Ducks dared to taste the (surprisingly delicious) beer concoction made from combining our excess samples, the comment cards got real: “Like stomach acid,” “Smooth like a baby’s bottom,” “Hoppy! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3”</p>
<p>Thanks to the Ducks' excellent taste in beverages—and to the superb beer-brewing abilities of New Yorkers from Ithaca to Red Hook—the challenge was a success. The winners are (drum roll, please):</p>
<p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Coney Island IPA</p>
<p><strong>Refreshment Factor: </strong>Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold</p>
<p><strong>Flavor:&nbsp; </strong>Blue Point Toasted Lager</p>
<p><strong>Most points overall: </strong>Blue Point Toasted Lager</p>
<p>Congratulations, <a href=""http://www.bluepointbrewing.com/"" target=""_parent"">Blue Point Toasted Lager</a>! Big Duck is a fan.</p>

<p>Awesome! You’ve just been asked to create the new visual identity for an orphanage of 35-plus children in Tijuana, Mexico. You’ve met and talked with the director and the only staff member. Where is the Communications Manager you ask? Administrative assistant? Fundraising Manager? Social Media Specialist? Oh, the director assumes these roles when time permits? Soon you begin sympathizing with the orphanage believing that the priorities of their shoestring budget — food, clothes, heath care, education, a roof, and actual shoestrings — trump the need for a long-term vision and communication plan.</p>
<p>In 2007 I was approached by the director of <a href=""http://www.losangelitos.org/"" target=""_parent"">Los Angelitos Orphanage</a> to take a look at the visual identity and make any changes that I saw fit. Using my experience as a for-profit communicator, I went ahead with what I knew. A long-term vision was never realized prior to the identity development process. Creating communications that solicited <a href=""http://www.losangelitos.org/donate.html"" target=""_parent"">donations</a> was job one, so a consistent and engaging visual system had to be developed quickly. In light of Los Angelitos’ immediate needs and my lack of experience with nonprofits, I felt it necessary to put the development of a long-term communication plan on the back burner…on the stove…next to their empty fridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2012 — Los Angelitos has a new visual identity and some semblance of a consistent communications effort. But they were still without a long-term vision and communication strategy. It was about this time when Sarah Durham’s book <em>Brandraising</em> was brought to my attention. Sarah, and the many examples sited within <em>Brandraising</em>, gave me some fodder for a case for to develop a long-term, nonprofit communication strategy. I started talking with the director about the true value of communications and how they could be measured. I reasoned that any communication campaign that Los Angelitos delivers would be up against the 3,000 to 5,000 marketing messages that people receive each day from both nonprofits and for-profits.</p>
<p>As explained in the book, it’s important to get the staff and board on the same page about where a nonprofit is heading in the longterm before Brandraising can begin. I figured it would go a long way in establishing clarity of purpose if it were articulated visually what Los Angelitos does. With this in mind I began working on an information graphic as a way to show why Los Angelitos exists and how it proposed to make good on its promise to the children, their supporters, and the community in general. Not to mention the director and the board.</p>
<p>The final graphic highlighted findings that showed how Mexico was creating the tools and market to support investment, development, and growth. In addition, with new economic reforms on the horizon, Mexico will be in dire need of college graduates to fill business leadership and policy-making roles. The knowledge acquired from a Los Angelitos-funded college education would allow the girls at Los Angelitos to influence the Mexican economy and society. In an ambitious way, Los Angelitos could be instrumental in making the street children of Mexico a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The infographic helped us move closer to articulating a vision. From this rough vision a clearer mission began to evolve, one that directs the orphanage’s efforts toward healing, rehabilitating, and acclimating the street girls of the Tijuana border area by providing them with a nurturing home and a higher education. This is a value that potential donors can relate to because it’s about creating and sustaining a healthy life cycle for both the children and the greater Mexican community.&nbsp;If Los Angelitos follows this path, they can begin establishing a leadership position around the core issue of helping homeless, abused, and starving street children, as well as rehabilitating a struggling society.</p>
<p>It’s now believed, by both the director and the board, that helping the street girls of the Tijuana border area does not stop when they turn 18, but should continue into adulthood, and that by way of this effort, Los Angelitos is helping the greater Mexican community. The emotional stories told by these girls have been collected and shared through several campaigns via email, social media sites, and fundraising kits. Comments have been positive. Communication efforts, while still being developed, have increased funding via online solicitations and have attracted a wider base of supporters ranging from pop-music stars to commercial contractors.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1","Blog | Brandraising a nonprofit in need","","","big duck blog guest blog brandraising to help the lost children of the tijuana border area","brandraising book sarah","brandraising book sarah durham","",

<p>Like many of my nonprofiteer friends, I’ve been thinking a lot about this issue and have led some workshops about it under the banner of, “Getting donors to fall in love with you.” Last month, in connection with Valentine’s Day, I got to share some smarts on this topic at 501 Tech NYC (a local meetup for NTEN members and their friends).

Like&nbsp;most long-term investments, diversifying your funding and prioritizing your individual donors is as important and worthwhile as it is difficult to implement, the sort of thing that's all too easily forgotten amidst the more urgent demands of your day-to-day work.

In other words, yes, that old adage about not putting too many eggs in one basket applies to the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>You never—and I'm not usually one to say never—want to depend on a limited number of sources for all of your funding, for a variety of reasons. At its core, diverse fundraising is really about your nonprofit's long-term resiliency, and we've seen many organizations take on the challenge of rethinking or expanding how they raise money, usually aming to reach more individual donors.</p>
<p>You don't need me to tell you that it can be a challenging process, one that takes time and money. And like so many other long-term investments, it's as important and worthwhile as it is difficult to implement, the sort of thing that's all too easily forgotten amidst the more urgent demands of your day-to-day work. Luckily, there are things you can do to make the process as successful and pain-free as possible. Here are a few tips.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Set the stage internally.</h3>
<p>Getting things in order internally is key to making any communications-related initiative a success, but it's especially important if you're setting out to diversify your fundraising, something that requires dedicated and knowledgeable staff who are empowered to implement changes over time. You'll need clarity on your specific goals as well as clarity on their implications, in terms of what you'll be asking of your team in the coming months (and years). In other words, ""making this a part of so-and-so's job"" isn't really a viable solution. You might even want to consider whether or not you need to create a new role. Remember that investing early in building your team's skills will pay off in the long run.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Get your priorities in order.</h3>
<p>Maybe major donors are some of your likeliest prospects. Perhaps it's the other way around, and reaching out to low-level donors is your best bet. Whatever your situation is, decide what you want to prioritize and identifiy some clear goals. If you're not sure where to start, take a close look at your resources. You might have some great opportunities to reach out to potential major donors through your board, or even their connections.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">It's all about relationships.</h3>
<p>Developing (and maintaining) strong relationships is key to reaching out to individual donors. There are different things you'll want to think about depending on whether you're focusing on major gifts or lower-level donations. Here are some more specific things to experiment with as you build these connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's important to remember that although foundations and individual donors are both sources of funding, they're entirely different. Foundations exist solely to give out money to organizations like yours, if not yours specifically. People don't. You need to work extra hard to get them to give money to your nonprofit. Compelling stories go far.</li>
<li>If you're prioritizing major donors, you'll want to invest in the materials you need to make a powerful impression in person, whether that means developing a nice leave-behind, a presentation, or talking points.</li>
<li>Unlike the majority of your lower-level donors, major donors will want to hear the nitty-gritty details about your programs and your impact and to feel, overall, like partners in your work.</li>
<li>In terms of reaching out to lower-level donors, you'll want to develop an ongoing campaign calendar. Focus on growing your social media presence, building your list, and giving everyone in your community ongoing ways to get and stay involved, even beyond donating. There's a nifty little concept we like to refer to as <a href=""/5_steps_on_your_ladder_of_engagement"" target=""_blank"">the ladder of engagement</a>, and it's extremely useful in instances like these.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Send the right messages.</h3>
<p>When it comes to growing your fundraising program, your brand—including your messaging—is really a tool you can use to help build the strong relationships that you need. A <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">successful nonprofit brand</a> communicates what makes your organization unique and helps people connect with it on an emotional level, which puts you way ahead of the fundraising game. If you don't have a strong foundation in you brand or in the messages you're sending, that might mean it's a great time to rethink your communications more broadly with your fundraising goals in mind.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Remember, patience is a virtue.</h3>
<p>Diversifying your fundraising is a long-term process. It takes time, hard work, thoughtful planning—and patience. (Realistic expectations are probably a good idea, too.) It's unlikely that you'll see the results immediately—it's a big shift, and individual donor programs usually take a couple of years before you'll really start to see a difference, though there may be some initial returns—but it's an investment you can make today that's sure to pay off in the long term.</p>

Why, the Nonprofit Technology Conference (<a href=""http://www.nten.org/"" target=""_parent"">NTC</a>), of course!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Nonprofit Technology Network’s (NTEN) annual conference is the only nonprofit-sector conference I’ve ever been to where tech early adopters, strategists, developers, and the ‘next gen’ of leadership get together and, well, crash a hotel’s internet connection in record speed.</p>
<p>This year, themes like disruption, sustainable workplace habits, and how mid-level people can inspire change in their nonprofit’s leadership dominated. Sure, technology is a big topic- but the bigger topic continues to be harnessing limited staff time and management skills to get things done.</p>
<p>I led and participated in several sessions, where books like <em>Lean In</em>, <em>Delivering Happiness</em> or <em>The Lean Startup</em> came up repeatedly, applicable for the lessons they teach about leadership, workplace values, and agility. (My new pal Alex Kadin, a techie at Repair the World, put together <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/bigducknyc.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoRwbwboPoGvdGtwY0ZKVmlZRDdiRmdTdnJoSU5zQ0E#gid=3"" target=""_parent"">this handy dandy book list</a> in case you're looking for more fodder for your Kindle.)</p>
<p>While people who love or work in tech-related jobs in the nonprofit sector consider the NTC a must-attend event, I was pleased to see more development and communications staff people attending this year. After all, technology is just a utility we use in the service of other things- communication, fundraising, advocacy,&nbsp; and outreach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thinking of attending the NTC next year? It’s going to be in Austin, Texas! Look for the exact dates and register on <a href=""http://www.nten.org/"" target=""_parent"">NTEN’s site</a>. And while you’re there, consider becoming a member. This is a great organization just about anyone in the nonprofit sector can benefit from.</p>

Having settled into a working system, Megan agreed to share some dos and don'ts for handling internal feedback during a rebrand.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Gathering feedback is one of the hardest but most important steps in a rebrand. When it comes to branding, everyone has an opinion—and those opinions often contradict. And many staff members have never been part of a rebrand and aren’t sure how to approach the process.</p>
<p>So how do you get good feedback? And how do you turn that feedback into something useful? Here are a few things we’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p>Good feedback takes time. Our organization has a ""core team"" of key staff leaders, assembled specifically for this project. We have a regular weekly meeting, plus occasional extra meetings.</p>
<p>Of course it is challenging to add these meetings to our normal responsibilities. But it’s a short-term investment for long-term gain. A rebrand can be an intense few months, but the benefits last through the lifespan of your organization.</p>
<p>Respect the team’s time by structuring meetings wisely. Rather than crowding the agenda, plan meetings around a single objective. When possible, share materials beforehand so team members can come prepared.</p>
<p>Ask targeted questions. Give examples of helpful feedback. Let the team know what is open for debate, and what is non-negotiable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask follow-up questions to better understand objections. Remember: even experts at their jobs can be novices at rebranding, unsure how best to articulate their comments. The goals and concerns that are behind a comment often reveal common ground, even amidst apparent disagreement.</p>
<p>Occasionally, offer to stock the conference room candy bowl. It helps.</p>
<p>Accept that you will not get everyone to agree on every decision. Those visions of an angel choir and a standing ovation accompanying your new logo? Probably best to let them die right now.</p>
<p>Be willing to make an unpopular decision. <i>Before</i> you start, make sure that the team knows who has decision-making authority when you're at an impasse. But don't be arbitrary. ""Because I said so"" hasn’t been a good answer since kindergarten. Take the time needed to help your team understand why the decision was made, even if they don’t agree.</p>
<p>Consolidate feedback as if it were a writing assignment, not meeting minutes. Look for themes. Group comments by topic. Make connections. Elaborate where unclear. Condense or eliminate rabbit trails.</p>
<p>Most importantly, keep a sense of humor and remember why you’re doing this. Very few nonprofit employees see their work as “just a job.” The ultimate goal is to support a mission that you’re all passionate about. Be grateful for that passion, even when passionate opinions make the rebrand process challenging.</p>

I worked out of my living room for the first six months, and for just about anyone who would hire me. But pretty fast there was more work than I could handle alone, and I started hiring people.</p>
<p>By 1995, we had an office and a lot of nonprofit work. We also did work in other sectors; we designed a couple of magazines, did marketing for a few small publishing imprints, even helped a few small and mid-size corporations with their marketing. We were a ‘jack of all trades’ type firm; masters of nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes we lucked out, developing very successful brands and campaigns without really understanding our clients’ businesses deeply- just going on gut and hard work. But very early on, I could see that the most successful projects were the ones where we understood not just what the client’s goals were, but some of the variables that were unique to their industry.</p>
<p>By 1999, the majority of our clients were nonprofits. I was most passionate about helping them, and their problems felt complex and more interesting. For-profit businesses have clear goals and a fairly straightforward bottom line. Nonprofits, on the other hand, have multiple constituents who may not ever overlap (board, donors, volunteers, clients, partners), and even fewer resources at their disposal to reach and engage them. It became clear that understanding these audiences and complexities was key to doing this work well.</p>
<p>Here’s one example. Years ago, we had two branding projects kick off during the same month. One was for a corporation where the CEO’s assistant was our primary contact, and the CEO was the decision-maker. The other was for a nonprofit where we were working with a committee composed of staff and board decision-makers, and a development associate who was our primary contact. Three months later, the corporate rebrand was done: the CEO was a swift decision-maker, so we were able to move fast. His staff was used to embracing and implementing his decisions, so they integrated the new brand fast internally, too. On the other hand, the nonprofit rebrand was really just getting started; designing a process to involve the right stakeholders at the right junctures (not to mention schedule calls and meetings) took time. Along the way, ideas had to be vetted deeply across the organization: would the new visual identity work as well for fundraising as it would for the clients who benefited from their services? Making sure the right people had a voice in the process was also key to success, we learned fast, as was educating staff who had limited experience with marketing.</p>
<p>By 2000, I’d decided to specialize in nonprofits, and made it a goal to immerse myself deeply in the conferences, books, publications, and other resources that would help me become an expert. I found I had barely scratched the surface. I started hiring experts with nonprofit sector experience whenever possible.</p>
<p>Donor retention? LYBUNT? SYBUNT? Governance? Advancement department? Turned out there was a lot to learn. In particular, where fundraising is concerned, there were (and still are) a lot of useful data, best practices, and benchmarks. The more my (now growing and growing) staff learned, the more we found we were delivering strategies and creative work that hit the mark and achieved the desired results. We also got faster, which made us less expensive, as service firms like Big Duck set their fees based on how long a project’s scope will take.</p>
<p>This year, Big Duck is turning 20 years old! It’s amazing to think about the many organizations we’ve helped increase their visibility, raise money, recruit participants, and more. We’ve helped raise millions of dollars! We’ve had clients grow and sustain much larger annual operating budgets. We’ve seen huge advances in several areas because of our clients’ work, and we’ve been a part of it. That’s thrilling in a way I can’t even describe, and I’m very proud of. I am deeply content, maybe even smug, in the knowledge that I’m spending my working hours doing something that feels right.</p>
<p>But for a nonprofit that’s thinking of hiring Big Duck, what really matters is expertise; a track record of success. Working with an agency like us is a big investment of money and time. To me, hiring a firm to help you rebrand or launch a campaign that doesn’t specialize in your field is a bit like being operated on by a doctor who’s a generalist. I’d rather hire the surgeon who’s done a thousand appendectomies than the one who’s dabbled in them a few times. Wouldn’t you?&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1066%2,1413%3","Big Duck's road to nonprofit specialization","As Big Duck's anniversary approaches, we look back on how we became experts in nonprofit communications and fundraising consulting.

(We Ducks have a practice of regularly reconnecting with past clients to assess how effective our work was, as any serious practitioner should, and using that research to refine or confirm our approach.)</p>","<p>I recently asked a number of our clients from the past 10 years or so to participate in a survey so we can assess the outcomes of Big Duck’s branding work. (We Ducks have a practice of regularly reconnecting with past clients to assess how effective our work was, as any serious practitioner should, and using that research to refine or confirm our approach.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our survey sparked an email exchange with James D. Merriman, the CEO of the <a href=""http://www.nyccharterschools.org/"" target=""_parent"">New York City Charter School Center</a>. Big Duck took the Charter Center through our brandraising process several years ago. We conducted market research, developed a strategy, created a new visual identity, tagline, and messaging platform, built a new website, and more. In our email exchange, James noted that the work we did together was a “key component in their success”, but then cautioned, “but if you don’t execute well on a clearly-defined mission, then all the branding in the world will get you <i>bupkis</i>.” (How cool is it that he used the word ‘bupkis’ in an email? I love this guy.)</p>
<p>James is right. A strong brand isn’t about having the right logo, tagline, messages, or other things you’ll use to communicate. First and foremost, a strong brand is your reputation, and it emerges from your work, which has to be clear, and should be excellent.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, it’s become obvious to me that a good organizational development (O.D.) process is critical to making sure the organization is still clear about its vision, mission, values, and objectives. For most organizations, a formal strategic planning process jumpstarts this process, and can have a profound ability to refocus and re-energize staff. In others, the process is less formal, but the result is the same: everyone is clear where the organization is heading, why it needs to go there, and what the benefit will be to the people or issue that it serves. Many successful nonprofits make a practice of conducting a thoughtful O.D. process at every 5 years, or even more frequently.</p>
<p>If your organization is struggling with basic questions about its mission, the people it serves, or why donors should support it, don’t think about rebranding just yet. First, hire experts to help the staff and board revisit these fundamental questions and chart a smarter path forward. Once your team has clarity on where you’re heading (and why you need to go there) it will be much easier to develop the communications components that will express what you’re about clearly and effectively. With both internal alignment and the right way to express your work externally you’ll be much more likely to reach and engage your audiences effectively.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1413%2,1409%3,1408%4,1407%5,1410%6","Good branding = good organizational development","","","the importance of strategic planning and organizational development","strategy brandraising rebrand development planning","strategy development brandraising branding identity mission messaging staff communications rebrand","",

Go Lions!)&nbsp;Working with the Vera Institute of Justice on their year-end fundraising this past December really hit home why that is.</p>","<p>There are a lot of ways we can help nonprofits with their campaigns at Big Duck, but recently I’ve been loving the potential I see in <a href=""/professional_fundraising_marketing_and_logos_for_nonprofits?project_type=1354&amp;sector="" target=""_blank"">our campaign coaching</a>—and not *just* because it let’s me imagine myself in the role of Coach Taylor from Friday Night Lights. (Though ok, that’s part of it. Go Lions!)</p>
<p>Working with the <a href=""http://www.vera.org/"" target=""_parent"">Vera Institute of Justice</a> on their year-end fundraising this past December really hit home why that is.</p>
<p>It was a pretty lean, targeted way of working together—our three months of coaching included weekly calls, high-level campaign planning, creative direction, and editing. That meant we could only look at the most immediate opportunities ahead of us and there wasn’t room to totally reinvent their campaign outreach.</p>
<p>And yet they ended up uncovering several promising lessons about their online supporters, and raising nearly 35% above their fundraising goal.</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that Vera had a great mission and was a total delight to work with, I realize there are a few reasons why they were the right kind of organization at the right moment for coaching to deliver some really exciting returns.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about dipping your toe in the multichannel campaign waters, maybe consider whether you’re also at the following jumping off point…</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">They were ready to up their game.</h3>
<p>When I first spoke with Joel Levy, Vera’s super-supportive development director, he was very clear that they had a few opportunities they were ready to seize: They had made an organizational commitment to <a href=""/big-duck-blog-tips-for-diversifying-your-nonprofits-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">diversifying their funding</a>&nbsp;beyond foundation and major donor support, they had the momentum of a new Executive Director who was excited to try a new way of engaging supporters through campaigns, and thanks to a speech by Attorney General Eric Holder, their issue was in the news.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">But they weren’t quite ready to go pro.</h3>
<p>Vera knew that doing campaigns the most effective way—on a year-round basis, with thorough planning, cross-promotion, and adequate time and budget for copy and design—takes an investment in staff time and dollars. But before they explored a bigger commitment in the coming year, they wanted to sound out whether their list was likely to respond to a new kind of campaign. Coaching let us take a baby step toward this new campaigning, and assess its future potential, without breaking the bank.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">They focused on the right goals.</h3>
<p>From our first call, it was clear that Vera was not just narrowly focused on the short-term metric of total amount of dollars raised—they knew this was also about learning lessons and building for the future. So in addition to overall returns, they set out goals for engaging new donors at new gift levels, building staff capacity, and testing out a new, more personal way of writing their appeals.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Their team was nimble…</h3>
<p>Thanks to the fact that Vera’s leadership was behind the goal of exploring new kinds of campaigning, the small team I worked with was empowered to make quick decisions and keep the plans moving forward even when we did need to consult Vera’s leadership. Even better, they were also flexible about what they might try. When I noted that some of their wish-list testing opportunities either were too expensive, too time-intensive, or, from my experience, wouldn’t get them meaningful insight—they paused on those efforts and focused on the ones we agreed as a team could realistically get us the biggest returns. I was super impressed by how quickly and pleasantly they changed course.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">…and their team was in it to win it.</h3>
<p>One of the things about coaching is that Big Duck is on the sidelines—unlike projects where we actually create most of the materials, I can’t get on the field and help make the plays happen. Vera’s team knew this and was ready to invest a lot of staff time and energy into drafting, coding, and designing their campaign materials. They probably needed a big glass of champagne to unwind by the time we sent our last appeal on New Year’s Eve, but they had totally earned it, and learned a lot about campaign best practices and what goes into a more mature campaign program in the process.</p>
<p>By January, I had seen their team go from enthusiastic beginners to strategic—and still devoted!—campaign learners and implementers. It still makes me smile to think about how far they came so fast.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to explore taking your campaigns to the next level with a limited budget, and have the energy and team capacity to take on some of the heavy lifting yourself, you might <a href=""/non_profit_marketing_and_fundraising_training"" target=""_blank"">consider coaching</a> as a first step. I’ll happily pepper you with Coach Taylor inspirational quotes as I cheer you onto the field!</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2,1406%3,1067%4","A look at successful year-end fundraising coaching","Want to expand and improve on your nonprofit's campaign strategy?

<p>Digital experts and traditional fundraisers alike have all been racing to keep up, and some useful online fundraising ‘best practices’ have emerged. (We know, for example, where that ‘donate’ button should go and how it should look, or how many ‘asks’ your email should probably include). &nbsp;Sometimes the latest digital ‘best practices’ are really just adaptations of old-school fundraising techniques. Matching gifts, a/b testing, segmentation: these are tactics that are as evergreen as a Douglas fir tree.</p>
<p>So given this veritable shmorgasbord of strategies, tactics and tools, how do you know if the team you’ve assembled to ramp up your nonprofit’s online fundraising is up to snuff? Here are three questions that will help you figure out if you’ve got the right team.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>What fundraising experience do you have? </b></h3>
<p>Times and technology may change, but the principles of fundraising remain largely the same. Does your team include people with a track record of successfully cultivating, soliciting, and stewarding individual donors online and off? Remember, ‘online’ is a just one channel to reach people. It’s more important that they are, first and foremost, fundraisers- not techies.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Are you in compliance with charitable registration laws?</b></h3>
<p>Charitable registration laws require nonprofits and, often, the consultants they work with to be registered on a state-by-state basis. Your team should be clear what those laws are, and should be maintaining compliance. Many independent fundraising consultants and some nonprofits overlook these laws, but not being compliant can lead to penalties and major headaches. Need to tackle charitable registration? Look to your state attorney general’s office for guidelines.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>How do you keep up with trends and tried-and-true techniques in the online fundraising world?</b></h3>
<p>New principles and practices emerge fast. Make sure your team, whether they are staff, consultants, or an agency you hire, embraces a culture of learning and growth.</p>
<p>Trade associations like the <a href=""http://www.afpnet.org/"" target=""_parent"">Association of Fundraising Professionals</a> or <a href=""http://www.nten.org/"" target=""_parent"">NTEN</a> are a great place to start. Both&nbsp;provide useful publications, excellent conferences, and professional development events all the time. Through them, you’ll hear recent case studies and research findings, and build a network of peers who can make sure you’re benefiting from what others have already learned.</p>
<p>If you’re in New York, check <a href=""http://www.nycafp.org/events/fund-raising-day-new-york"">out Fundraising Day New York</a>, which is coming up on June 27.

<p dir=""ltr"">The same goes for nonprofit special events.

Flowers are blooming, grass is growing, and… boards are approving budgets for organizations whose fiscal year begins July 1! &nbsp;Before this magical moment slips away into the haze of summer, consider these three questions:</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Have we budgeted for smaller projects that will help us move toward bigger projects?</h3>
<p>A big project often begins by conducting research, an audit, or a feasibility study. If you anticipate launching a major capital campaign, rebranding, overhauling your website, or tackling other really big projects downstream, consider budgeting a smaller amount for Phase One this year to get the ball rolling and to offset the overall cost of your projects over time. If you’ve already begun the first part of the project, you might also find it’s easier to get approval for its second phase next fiscal year.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Have we budgeted adequately for website updates?</h3>
<p>Best practices and technology can change fast in the online world. If it’s been a while since you’ve done so, you might want to budget for website testing, to explore how donors, clients, or other important audiences are engaging with your site. If possible, give yourself a budget to fix any problems or fill any gaps this testing uncovers.</p>
<p>We generally encourage nonprofits to budget for some online work every year. In years when bigger changes are needed, the dollar amount is greater. But even in years when no big changes are made, it’s useful to have a discretionary budget you can spend on testing, editing, creating campaign-specific pages or microsites, or any other ‘rainy day’ projects.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Have we budgeted for help where we need it most?</h3>
<p>Dan Pallotta’s&nbsp;2013 TEDtalk “<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong"" target=""_parent"">The way we think about charity is dead wrong</a>”&nbsp;got people talking about how a Puritan cultural hangover has resulted in nonprofits underpaying or neglecting things generally associated with a professional working environment. So what’s getting in the way of you doing your best work? Is it an out-of-date content management system (CMS), your database, or a piece of software? Perhaps you need to learn about a new trend in the sector or develop your skills by attending more conferences? Maybe you could use help from a freelance writer or graphic designer to professionalize your materials? This might be the moment to budget for projects that will help you get to the next level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are, of course, an overwhelming number of projects worth pursuing and never enough time or money to tackle them all. But if you can focus on a few discrete projects that move things forward, you might find the long-term implications are stronger than you think</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2063%1,2061%2,1405%3,1067%4","Where to focus when planning your budget","For many nonprofits, July 1 rings in the new fiscal year.

The board needs to feel confident that the organization’s new brand and communications materials are reflective of their point of view, which can be very different from staff’s.

The board needs to feel confident that the organization’s new brand and communications materials are reflective of their point of view, which can be very different from staff’s. Staff members want to shape and direct the new brand because they have to live with it. They also know from experience what will and won’t work, in practical terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The culture and dynamics of board meetings can play an unexpectedly big role in how branding–or, really any–work is received and responded to. We’ve seen boards embrace the improbable, reject ideas the staff felt confident would be a slam-dunk, and surprise us in various ways over the years. The one conclusion I’ve safely drawn is that thinking about when, how, and who works with the board is often as important as the work itself.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips I’ve found really help keep a rebranding process focused and productive while giving the board a voice in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1.&nbsp;Include a few key board members in the process, and expect them to promote it to the rest of the board.</h3>
<p>When we’re helping an organization go through our <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">brandraising process</a>, we often collaborate with a committee that includes both staff and board members. Ideally, that committee is small but mighty, and has the authority to approve the work, too.</p>
<p>The ideal committee has 5-10 people on it. It includes the executive director, head of development, head of communications, board chair, and perhaps other highly respected board members (ideally ones with marketing or fundraising clout).</p>
<p>Board members on this committee should know that their role is a two-way street; they are the bridge between the work and the board. They will represent board members' opinions and views to make sure work reflects the board’s unique perspective (not just their own individual perspective). Secondly, they will communicate back to the board about the work, ideally explaining it and advocating for it. When questions emerge, they might ‘workshop’ something with other board members, seeking advice or input where helpful, and reporting back to the committee.</p>
<p>Last year, we worked with a particularly fabulous board member during one rebrand. He not only offered useful suggestions at the committee level, but he presented the work effectively to his board colleagues, explained it, and fought for it, when needed. He was deeply engaged in the process, passionate about keeping it focused on the best ideas, and willing to fight for it. We love that guy! Much more importantly, the end result was much stronger because of him.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2.&nbsp;Invite the board’s honest feedback at key junctures along the way.</h3>
<p>Nobody likes big surprises or to be told about decisions made long ago that affect them deeply. On the other hand, involving everyone everywhere is inefficient and will take much longer than necessary. Worse than that, it typically leads to everyone’s ideas getting Frankensteined together, creating a veritable monster you’ll probably regret.</p>
<p>Have the people involved in the process keep the board in the loop along the way by reporting at board meetings, calling people with updates, or sending emails. Ideally, look for places where the work is far enough along that you feel it’s on the right track but not totally done, and invite their feedback.</p>
<p>We recently presented draft vision, mission, and values statements at an organization’s board meeting. The drafts were close, but not quite done, so it was the perfect time to get a fresh perspective on them. After the strategy and process were explained to the board, the executive director and board members involved in the process added their support for the work and asked for candid feedback. Board members chimed in with what they liked and what they felt might be missing. Ideas were explored and debated. The next draft integrated the ideas the executive director supported. When the final version was presented to the full board, it felt familiar, reflective of that earlier discussion, and the board already understood the thinking behind it. After a brief discussion and thanks to the committee for their hard work on it, it was approved by the full board for adoption.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3.&nbsp;Tell your board where they get to offer input–and where they don’t.</h3>
<p>I recently presented at a board meeting where my job was to update the board on a process that involved comprehensive changes to their messaging and visual identity. Before I began my presentation, the executive director did something we ask every client to do: she set me up for success. She reminded the board why they’d hired Big Duck in the first place, underscored her confidence in our expertise, and reminded the board that while they are Captains of Industry, the firm they’d hired are Captains of Nonprofit Communications. She told them the board’s role was to offer feedback and reactions, not to suggest colors or wordsmith. “We’ve hired people who do this for a living,” she reminded them, “and our conversations with you should be focused on a higher level.”</p>
<p>It worked like a charm. The board was focused, offered great feedback about what they liked and what concerned them. We left with a clear sense of where we had their support, where more work was needed, and what refinements should be made.</p>
<p>No matter who’s presenting, helping the board stay focused on when and how they get to play a role in the process is productive. Many people, especially board members who are less experienced in the ways of nonprofits, appreciate the guidance on when and how to offer input.</p>
<p>How do you and your board work together to ensure outcomes both staff and board can agree on and feel good about?</p>","","","a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:12:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:20900;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:12:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1407%2,1414%3,1410%4","Tips for efficient collaboration with your board","When going through a rebrand, it's important to smartly manage your team's communication and relationship with your organization's board.

<p>That's usually the first question on everyone's minds at the end of a big campaign push. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to answer—and it's not even the most important question.</p>
<p>Here are the three questions your team should discuss as you evaluate your campaign's performance.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1. Did we achieve our objectives?</h3>
<p>This question assumes that you've set clear objectives up front. Without objectives, it's impossible to say for sure whether your campaign was a success—it's like asking, ""How long is a piece of string?""</p>
<p>Make sure you know at the outset what success looks like, so that you'll know it when you see it. How many new people do you want on the list? How many dollars raised and from whom? How do you want to change people's perceptions, and how will you know if you did?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. Why?</h3>
<p>It's not enough to know whether you succeeded. If you don't find out why, you're only getting part of the story.</p>
<p>Perhaps you reached your overall fundraising goal, but only because a major donor stepped in at the last moment with a $10,000 gift. Maybe you fell short of your target registration numbers, but a major national news story caused a big distraction right as you were building momentum.</p>
<p>Understanding these nuances helps you decide how to proceed in the short-term, as well as how you can adapt moving forward. Which leads me to...</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3. What can we learn for next time?</h3>
<p>You worked hard to make your campaign happen—don't let all that effort go to waste! A little bit of time reflecting and jotting down recommendations for next time will set you up to do even better in the future (and avoid repeating mistakes).</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas of what you might look into:</p>
<ul>
<li>What tactics (email, word of mouth, social outreach, direct mail, advertising, etc.) worked the best in terms of achieving our objectives?</li>
<li>What was least effective? Why?</li>
<li>What did we spend the most time on during the campaign, and was it worth the time?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How did each of our emails perform (opens, clicks, completion rates)? Why? Were there any differences by segment?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That's my short list—anything I'm missing? Let me know what questions you ask in your own debriefs (and what you've learned from them) in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To answer that question, Big Duck commissioned the fabulous research firm FDR Group to help us conduct a formal survey. The results of what happen when most nonprofits rebrand are surprising, and unequivocal. Rebranding is, for the majority of organizations that do it, really helping in many ways.</p>
<p>How, you ask? The data shows that rebranding helps improve revenue, increase numbers of donors and donor retention, recruit program participants, engage activists, and more. <a target=""_parent"" href=""/rebrandeffect"">Download our free ebook, <i>The Rebrand Effect</i>, to read it for yourself.</a></p>

<p>Big Duck is turning twenty years old this month (I know, I know: we don’t look a day over sixteen, right?)! We’re celebrating in all sorts of ways. To help you get in the mood, too, take a moment to reflect on four of 1994’s many cultural highs and lows.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1. <i>The Lion King</i></h3>
<p>They sure don’t make Disney movies like the used to. <i>The Lion King</i> came out back in 1994, marking the official entry of “Hakuna Matata” into our vocabulary. We’ve been asking people, “Did you know it’s technically an adaptation of <i>Hamlet</i>?”—no, but really, did <i>you</i>?—at dinner parties ever since.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2. The Whack Heard Round the World</h3>
<p>Also known as Tonya Harding’s attack on Nancy Kerrigan. Thank goodness the darkest days in American figure skating are now two decades behind us.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3. The death of Kurt Cobain</h3>
<p>This one’s a sad one for many of us, personally. Had we never discovered Nirvana, we probably wouldn’t be nearly as obsessive-compulsive about music today.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">4. <i>My So-Called Life</i></h3>
<p>And then twenty years later, Jordan Catalano got his first Oscar!</p>
<p>Unlike ‘90s fashion trends that come and go (before coming back again), good nonprofit communications are here to stay. I know I speak on behalf of all the other Ducks when I say that it’s been a privilege working with some seriously lovely people from amazing organizations over the years.</p>

Does your site still feel and look like it’s a child of the '90s or has it kept up with the times—in both who your organization is now and current user experience trends?</p>
<p>Last month, I helped a few hundred nonprofiteers answer that mighty question: “Is it time to rethink your website?” Together we looked at the <a href=""http://care.org/"" target=""_blank"">evolution of CARE’s website</a> as well as <a href=""/the-marfan-foundation-brand"" target=""_blank"">the new site we redesigned for The Marfan Foundation as part of our brandraising process</a>.

<p>While I was able to answer some on-the-spot questions&nbsp;during the webinar about usability, audience-specific navigation, number of pages a site should have, buy-in issues, and whether or not you need to have an IT background to manage a site, I couldn’t get to them all. To help continue the conversation, here are a few of those questions and my responses. You can also <a href=""/big-duck-webinar-is-it-time-to-rethink-your-website"" target=""_blank"">watch the webinar here</a>&nbsp;and add your own question as comments to this post.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">To&nbsp;<a href=""#_msocom_7""></a>get to know our audiences, you suggested we create user personas. How do I do that?</h3>
<p>User personas, also known as audience personas or profiles, are a great tool for any communications process—especially websites. They are typically fictional profiles based on real members of your community. These profiles not only summarize the person’s demographic background, but they spell out that person’s motivations. Why are they coming to your site in the first place? What do they need to see in order to click deeper? The point of these profiles is to push you to think like your community and avoid organizing your site in ways that only make sense to you and your colleagues. Liz, our Director of Strategy, <a href=""/nice_to_meet_you_audience"" target=""_blank"">wrote a handy how-to about creating audience profiles</a>&nbsp;and my friend John Haydon <a href=""http://www.johnhaydon.com/2012/08/16/how-create-user-personas-for-your-website/"" target=""_blank"">offers some steps and examples of personas</a>&nbsp;on his website.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Can you recommend resources to learn more about how best to integrate customer service technology within the website?</b></h3>
<p>Great question. I’m don’t have a lot of experience with this, so I’d start by talking to the company that provides your <a href=""http://www.idealware.org/articles/few-good-constituent-relationship-management-tools"" target=""_parent"">Constituent Relationship Management</a>(CRM) system, if you have one. I do see more nonprofits are experimenting with the live chat functionality many of us have come to expect from shopping and travel sites. And some people even suggest <a href=""http://www.idealware.org/articles/few-good-constituent-relationship-management-tools"" target=""_parent"">offering live chat to engage with donors and volunteers</a>.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>For an audience of physically disabled people (auditory, visual, mobility limitations), how do you manage your design to be accessible? Making it easy to view and use while still looking modern and fresh.</b></h3>
<p>In 1998, the U.S. government amended <a href=""http://www.section508.gov/"" target=""_parent"">Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act</a>&nbsp;and required all federal agencies to produce sites that could be used by people with disabilities. While the law does not require all nonprofits to comply (unless they are part of a federal agency), creating an accessible website is considered a best practice by many and may be a priority based on an organization’s mission. To see if your site is accessible, <a href=""http://webaim.org/standards/508/checklist%20"" target=""_parent"">review this checklist from WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)</a>&nbsp;and this <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/web-designer/creating-an-ada-compliant-website"" target=""_blank"">helpful set of resources published on TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>To the question of whether or not a site can be accessible and still look good, I think it can. Take a look at the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov"" target=""_parent"">White House website</a> or <a href=""http://www.climate.gov"" target=""_parent"">NOAA Climate.gov</a> that just won a Webby award.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Are there any marketing or communication plan templates you can recommend</b><a href=""#_msocom_17""></a><b>?</b></h3>
<p>I love that you are asking about overall communications strategy in a discussion about websites. Bravo! Your website should follow your plan, not be your communications plan! &nbsp;<a href=""http://gettingattention.org/articles/69/planning-budgets/nonprofit-marketing-plan-template.html"" target=""_parent"">Nancy Schwartz has some great insights and a template for a nonprofit marketing plan</a>.

<p>This is probably the question I get asked most frequently when I give a workshop or speak on a panel about nonprofit branding.&nbsp; Getting everyone on the same page about a significant change in communications takes time and patience; that’s for sure. &nbsp;So how do you, the person who knows change needs to happen, help others arrive at that conclusion, too? Here are three ways to spark a constructive conversation about rebranding.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Take a hard look at yourself—from the outside in.</b></h3>
<p>Staff and board members rarely have time to pause, reflect, and look at what’s going on around them. But taking a look at how your organization and others in your space (peers, competitors, partners, etc) are communicating can be time well-spent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Periodically (I prefer once a year), lay the materials you’ve been producing out on a table and review them from a 20,000 foot view. Don’t forget to include a mix of items from your programs, fundraising, advocacy, and events. &nbsp;What are you doing well? What’s not working? Do they look, feel and sound consistent? Professional? Inspiring? (Don’t forget to print out pages from social media, your website, and other online stuff- or review it on screen.)</p>
<p>Next, Google some of the peers, partners, and other orgs you compete with for funding, clients, or attention. How are they communicating? Do they use Google adwords? Are their websites clear and well done? Are they using social media wisely? What are they communicating about themselves- and how do your communications stack up?</p>
<p>You may find this discussion immediately surfaces a sense of agreement and motivates your leadership to explore making changes. It might also illustrate that you’re really doing things well, in which case it may not be smart to make major changes. Either way, you’ll be opening up a productive discussion about communications that will help get everyone on the same page.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Provide them with evidence that rebranding really helps other organizations.</b></h3>
<p>Rebranding takes time, typically costs money, and is hard work. As if those aren’t barriers enough, many people also really wonder what the tangible benefits will be.</p>
<p>In early 2014, we completed a research study on the impact of rebranding on a nonprofit’s revenue, fundraising, programs recruitment. It’s free, not impossible to read, and includes findings gleaned from hundreds of nonprofits who’ve rebranded in recent years. <a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">Read more about it and download your copy here</a>.</p>
<p>In short, rebranding is, by and large, a good thing for organizations that undertake it. It’s particularly helpful if an organization has a new strategic plan, fundraising plan, or new staff leadership.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Don’t force the issue. </b></h3>
<p>Rebranding shouldn’t be taken lightly, or rushed. Your organization shouldn’t have to do regularly. When the time is right, you’ll want to do it well, and make sure people are truly invested in its success. It’s better to share resources, articles, and engage in discussions that don’t push an agenda. Instead, let your leadership arrive at their own conclusions, and provide them with resources and discussions that help them get there.</p>

But as one of Big Duck’s resident fundraising fiends, year-end campaign season--AKA, “a nonprofit’s most financially rewarding time of the year”--is always on my mind. So why do I want it on yours? Well, it really is never too early to get started, and I want to help make it easy—so let’s focus on the tools you already have: your brand and your donors.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Use your brand strategy to guide your fundraising</b></h3>
<p>If you’ve worked with us, <a href=""/brandraising%20"" target=""_blank"">read <i>Brandraising</i></a>, or attended one of our workshops, you know that the heart of your brand strategy is positioning and personality. Positioning is the big idea that you hope supporters associate with your organization. It's also what sets you apart. Personality is the set of attributes or feelings you want people to associate with your organization. With your organization’s positioning and personality in hand, you can develop or judge different creative themes for your fundraising campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because your year-end fundraising should be an extension of your work year-round, these communications should feel like an extension of your usual communications. Yes, your year-end campaign should be special, and this may be a time of year where you invest more time and money into what you send out. But if your year-end fundraising does not sound, look, and feel like you, your donors and prospects will be confused and less likely to give. Use year-end fundraising to accentuate your incredible work. It may be a promotion of your best self, but it is certainly your true self.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Appeal to your core donors – and acknowledge them too</b></h3>
<p>Fundraising campaigns typically focus on renewing the support of current donors, issuing a special appeal to all supporters, reinstating former donors, and/or acquiring new donors. For year-end efforts, we typically suggest you focus your campaign on getting repeat gifts from past supporters, either recent or lapsed, as opposed to running a major acquisition campaign to get new supporters. Certainly all gifts are welcome, including those from people who have not yet given to you, but you likely have a limited budget for printing and postage (yes, many of you should still be in the mail!), advertising on Google or social media, and/or bringing in outside help for strategy, copywriting, design, and/or coding.</p>
<p>By tailoring your approach to year-end fundraising to the people who already know you, you celebrate the ways they have helped you accomplish your victories and invite them to continue partnering with you into the future. As we enter the season of giving, be sure you not only ask people to donate, but you give them other actions to take and that you say 'thank you'. This can be a great time to make phone calls, send hand-written notes, post a video message or thanks, and <a href=""/big-duck-blog-getting-your-donors-to-fall-in-love-with-you-and-keep-giving"" target=""_blank"">let donors know that you love them.</a><a href=""#_msocom_2""></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>See this approach in action</b></h3>

Perhaps that’s why up until quite recently, people thought of rebranding as just a logo change. Although few of us have ranching experience, the term ‘branding’ has taken root and been adopted by individuals and organizations alike.</p>
<p>Today, ""rebranding"" is more commonly defined as a change in both visual and written elements; a bit more expansive than your logo, but still very much about the elements you use to communicate with external audiences. But your visuals and messaging—for instance, your name, logo, and tagline—are only as powerful as the strategy that drives them, the ways you communicate them, your ability to truly live them authentically, and how they are perceived.</p>
<p>Branding is about changing perception and growing reputation; often from the inside out. Deep shifts in how people work, organizational culture, and more might be in order.</p>
<p>To determine what rebranding really means for your nonprofit, you first need to agree on the model you’ll find most useful. And, in recent years, many different models have emerged to help businesses understand and change how they communicate in more sophisticated ways. Study branding and you’ll hear terms like “brand essence” or “brand connector” bandied about.</p>
<p>Big Duck coined the term ""brandraising"" (yes, we’ve created our own snappy branding model, too) to describe something larger and more holistic. <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising</a>&nbsp;is a communications framework that begins with a nonprofit’s vision, mission, and values, and threads its way through everything the organization does, internally and externally, to reach the people necessary to fundraise, run programs, advocate, and more.

We asked Ashley Kincaid, Executive Director of&nbsp;Pi Lambda Theta, to share her insights into the wonderful world of focus groups.</em></p>
<p>Rebranding an organization can be a perplexing process, even when all parties agree that it is long overdue. It’s a bold move to consider changing your organization’s name or logo—your core identity—and you want to be sure you get it right. But how can you be confident that the decisions you are making will have the intended effect? Our organization determined that engaging the voices of our key constituencies through focus groups was an important part of the process.</p>
<p>Considering focus groups? Here are a few tips that we learned along the way.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Think carefully about who to invite to the party.</strong>&nbsp;When involving current stakeholders, focus on those who are actively engaged in the organization. It not only gives you an opportunity to learn more about brand components that appeal to them, it also can shed light on fears and points of contention that may be bubbling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget external audiences. Though it is essential to engage current constituents, speaking to individuals who epitomize those that you are trying to attract can be equally as important if you are looking to dramatically grow your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Start with your organization’s mission.</strong> Kick off the focus group by reminding everyone what you’re all about and that you all are working toward the same goal. This can mitigate any negative feelings that current constituents may feel toward you and the rebrand.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Explain your vision.</strong>&nbsp;Lay out the organization’s plans for revitalization or growth. Make it clear how this new direction benefits them and get them excited!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Stay neutral…sort of.</strong> When sharing possible core identities, let participants know that you are excited about the options. However, don’t favor one over the other. You want participants to feel like their opinions matter — not that you’ve already made a decision and these conversations are “just for show.”</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Guide the feedback process.</strong> Ask participants to hold comments until you’ve presented all core identity options. At the end, project all logos on one slide with a list of your personality traits and positioning statement. Ask questions like, “Which logo/tagline/name best represents our new personality or positioning statement?” “Which best speaks to each of our target audiences?” This helps participants frame their feedback in your vision for the future and avoid comments like, “I just don’t like the vibe of that,” or, “I don’t like that color.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get valuable feedback, be sure to ask, “Why?” For example, it’s less important to know that your teen audience doesn’t like the color green and more important to know that they don’t like it because it doesn’t come across as powerful and dynamic.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Making sense of it all.</strong> Once you’ve finished, look for salient themes that span all conversations. Are there several takeaways that you heard over and over again? Also, couch feedback within the context of who said it. For example, you might pay more attention to individuals who typify the audiences you want to attract and downplay responses from those who are totally resistant to your vision of the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""alt""></p>
<p>Now that you have a grasp of what your audiences think, feel, and expect from your brand, use it. It can help you identify which core identity best suits your needs, what is successful about it, and what still needs work. But know that, ultimately, you have to make the call for what will best serve the organization in the long run.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1410%2","Leading focus groups to get feedback on logo","Ashley Kincaid writes a guest blog for Big Duck this week about how her organization engaged key stakeholders in their rebrand by conducting focus groups to test visual identity options.","","getting feedback from stakeholders during rebrand","testing rebrand brandraising logo users feedback ","testing rebrand brandraising logo users feedback rebranding focus groups clients","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusramberg/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Marcus Ramberg's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""92"">Marcus Ramberg</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>",

How will the changes you make connect back to your vision and mission? How will you bring that new brand to life? In my webinar, “Surviving the Rebrand (and living to tell the tale)”<span>—</span><a href=""/how-to-avoid-obstacles-while-overhauling-your-nonprofits-brand"" target=""_blank"">which you can watch online any time here</a><span>—</span>I mapped out these six steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Have a clear organizational strategy.&nbsp;</b>Clarity around your mission and values, who your audiences are, what actions you want them to take… that’s actually the stuff of strategic planning, which should happen upstream of rebranding. <a href=""/rebrandeffect"">Big Duck's ebook <em>The Rebrand Effect</em></a>&nbsp;explains how fifty-one percent of the 351 nonprofits polled said that strategic planning was the most influential thing moving their rebranding process forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more your board and your staff are aligned and clear about the mission, the more likely it is that your rebrand is going to reflect it.</p>
<p><b>Get buy-in.</b> Branding isn’t just about a logo change or messaging update. It impacts the culture of how your organization works together, <a href=""/build-buyin-for-rebrand-with-evidence-and-assessment-tools"" target=""_blank"">so making sure people are onboard and understand why you’re doing it is important.</a></p>
<p>In particular, consider bringing the people who aren’t convinced that the branding process is going to be helpful together, and have some frank discussions about it.</p>
<p>Here’s one way to do it: Book a conference room and put out on the table all of your brochures, your flyers, materials, printouts of social media or your website: anything your development and programs staff use to communicate with outside audiences. Really look at your materials: not from your own point of view, but from your audiences’ point of view.</p>
<p>What messages are you sending? What do these materials say about your organization? Are you communicating consistently?</p>
<p>Reviewing the websites of your peers and your competitors can also help you get your team aligned around changes you might make. Often, people who’ve been resistent to making changes see why it might help when they use these exercises to take a step back.</p>
<p><b>Start with a clear communication strategy.</b> You don’t want to leave the harbor unless you’re clear where you’re sailing the ship, right? Having a communication strategy means making sure what you want to communicate is clearly defined, ideally before you start making changes. That sounds really simple and obvious, but you’d be surprised how many organizations that rebrand jump right in to messaging or a logo redesign without stopping to ask the question, “What does this have to communicate?”</p>
<p>Branding, ultimately, is about reputation awareness, reputation shaping, and reputation management. If you don’t have a clear sense of how you’re perceived now, it’s very hard to know if you should actually make a change.</p>
<p>Many nonprofits require research to get a clearer picture of this area and to set a viable communications strategy. If you haven’t done any in a while, consider talking to both your internal and your external stakeholders to get a sense of how you’re perceived. What’s your organization known for? What’s the reputation that you currently have?</p>
<p><b>Ok, now you can rebrand.</b> <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">Rebranding your nonprofit might include changing your name, your logo, your tagline, developing key messages, writing an elevator pitch, rewriting your vision, mission, value statements</a>. It might even mean changing how you manage communications, or how departments collaborate, all in the name of working together to communicate ""on message.""</p>
<p><b>Bake it in.</b> Your staff and board will need simple tools they can use to communicate on brand consistently. Typically, we suggest a simple brand guide (including both visuals and messaging) <a href=""/contentmgr/Before%20your%20nonprofit%20rebrands,%20consider%20the%20timing%20and%20sequence%20that%20will%20help%20you%20do%20it%20right.%20How%20will%20the%20changes%20you%20make%20connect%20back%20to%20your%20vision%20and%20mission?%20How%20will%20you%20bring%20that%20new%20brand%20to%20life?%20In%20my%20webinar,%20“Surviving%20the%20rebrand%20(and%20living%20to%20tell%20the%20tale),”--which%20you%20can%20watch%20online%20any%20time%20here--I%20mapped%20out%20these%20six%20steps."" target=""_blank"">and a training or two</a>. Ideally, all new staff receive the guide and training as part of their onboarding.</p>
<p><b>Start campaigning.</b> Your rebrand isn’t really done until your website is updated, your social media adapted, and more. Once that’s in place, use your new brand in a year-end fundraising appeal, or perhaps launch a recruitment campaign to get new clients to come in for programs or services. Remember, campaigning is really where we start to move people up that engagement ladder.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1","Strategic planning and staff alignment for rebrand","How do you make sure your organization's rebrand has a long shelf line?

When you’re changing any of the elements in your brand, it’s wiser to do it slowly.

After all, you don’t want to rebrand every three years or every five years; this work should last as long as possible<span>—</span>ideally 10, 15, 20 years. Maybe even indefinitely.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rebranding itself is actually not the long part of a rebranding process. If you set your organization up correctly, rebranding can take as few as three months<span>—</span>maybe even fewer if you do it down-and-dirty<span>—</span>and as much as nine months.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But how do you plan ahead, when there are so many moving parts involved? Here’s a very light framework to jump-start your planning:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Year One:</strong><span> Revisiting your strategic plan (formally or informally) is often the best place to start if your organization hasn’t done it in three or more years. If your approach is fairly light or informal, it should take a few months. If you’re a larger organization where a working group and a complex set of variables is often a “given,” this process can take as much as a year to 18 months to complete. As part of your strategic planning, establish a communications strategy that emerges from your organizational goals.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You might also conduct internal stakeholder conversations or external market research to understand how you’re currently perceived. This is typically a two- to four-month long process.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Then go through the three- to nine-month task of rebranding, updating your visual identity and your messaging platform.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Year Two:</strong><span>&nbsp;Update your website, social media, templates, and launch your new brand. Let that new brand come to life in those long shelf-life materials you use to communicate with your clients, donors, peers, and other core audiences.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Launching can take some time. The process of updating your website, creating new print materials, and cultivating a new way of communicating online can often take more time than the rebrand itself. Plan for all of the moving parts by drafting a “roll out plan” in advance so you can manage it all proactively.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">There are many scenarios in which the magic of <em>marketing automation</em>—technology designed for organizations to more effectively market on multiple channels online, and automate repetitive outreach tasks—can be game-changing for nonprofit fundraising, recruitment, advocacy, and more. Especially over the last year or so, the ability to automate and personalize day-to-day online communications based on your audiences’ interactions with you, at a relatively low cost, has exploded. Not to mention, it’s pretty darn cool.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, without a clear strategy or goals, or understanding of the work and capacity it takes to make it a success, automating your fundraising or advocacy communications could just be a lot of set up and wheel spinning without any results—or worse, sending the wrong stuff to the wrong people. Is your nonprofit thinking about automating your online communications? Here’s 4 guideline to think about if so:</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">1. Expect to automate processes that already (at least somewhat) exist.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">For example, if you manually subscribe newsletter recipients to your year-end appeal lists, or send out segmented email appeals based on giving history, automation can be a great tool for making that happen more seamlessly, saving you time, reducing human error, and being more targeted to the audience segment. But if you want to, say, send “this is what your donation did” followup emails to your donors, or try your hand at engaging supports via blogs and images, but don’t currently do these things at all, implementing a tool isn’t going to solve your problem alone. Instead, start by defining your goals, objectives, audiences, and plan for any new initiative—and then set up the machine mechanics as a step 2, if it makes sense to automate them. Generally, backing strategy into a technology or tool can set you up for disappointment, so be sure you’re clear about this.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">2. You’ll need to clean AND rebuild the data house.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">We all know that having clean data on your supporters and advocates is helpful—but with today’s automation technology, it’s more complicated than spelling or dedupes or differentiating donors from prospects. List management can become faster and easier with new tools, but you need to decide some things before you make the move. What do you need to know about your constituents in order to gauge their level of interest, support and engagement with you, and send relevant communications? Their interests? Locations? Age? What actions they've taken on your website? Decide what your <a href=""/5_steps_on_your_ladder_of_engagement"" target=""_blank"">ladder of engagement</a>&nbsp;looks like, the pieces of information you should collect that indicate where someone is on that ladder, and then set up the tool. It’s easier than going back and changing how your data is organized and collected after your machine is moving. &nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">3. Growing your list is just one piece of the puzzle.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Whether the goal is fundraising, recruiting, or changing hearts and minds, we talk a lot about list-building in the nonprofit world. Building your list is just a first step. You’ll need to truly cultivate that list, pushing supporters up that <a href=""/5_steps_on_your_ladder_of_engagement"" target=""_blank"">ladder of engagement</a>, perhaps moving them from knowing nothing about you, to filling out an action alerts, to giving $5, to giving $100 annually—setting you up for true long-term success. But you’ll need to communicate differently with the folks who give you $100 annually and those who just joined your list. This requires a smart communications strategy and the bandwidth to keep the machine well-powered—not list growth alone. Like any automated machine, the more there is to process and produce, the bigger and more complicated an engine you’ll need.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">4. Focus on just a few key reports.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you do decide to spring for a fancy new marketing automation tool, once you’re up and running and have some data, looking at how your online communications are performing and how your audiences are engaging with you is a very important practice. But with tools like Salesforce that come with a million reports before you even start, it’s easy to drown in the infinite number of ways you can analyze your data. &nbsp;What are the five pieces of information you need to know in order to determine if your online communications are succeeding? Make a list of the five key reports that will tell you the answers, who needs to see them or be briefed on what the data is telling you, how often you need to look at them, and what you’re going to do with the information.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2,2063%3","Communications technology for nonprofits","Is it time for your organization to start using software that segment your lists and allow you to send more focused, strategic content to your audiences?

We’ve read hundreds of RFPs here at Big Duck, and we see nonprofits using them more and more to solicit proposals from potential communications agency partners—often in an attempt to assess different firms with standardized criteria.</span></span></p>
<p>If you’re preparing an RFP for a communications initiative now or soon, I’m here to help. Here’s five things I’d encourage you to include:</p>
<p><strong>1. The problem you want to solve. </strong>What’s causing you and/or your organization pain, when it comes to communicating? Write up a summary of what success looks like, or the pain you’re trying to soothe, rather than a list of project deliverables. It’s the consultant’s job to recommend the process and deliverables you go through to solve your problem, and chances are each firm will have its own approach. At this stage, you don’t yet need to worry about everything it will take to get to success.</p>
<p><strong>2. Your budget.</strong> If you’re issuing an RFP to a range of firms or vendors, it’s likely that you’ll get a range of responses in terms of cost. If possible, reach out to each firm first to get a sense of what they charge. It’ll save you time.</p>
<p><strong>3. Your timeline.</strong>&nbsp;Also, an explanation of what’s driving it, if there’s something specific driving it. If you’re in a rush because you’re just plain eager to get the work done, that’s helpful to know too.</p>
<p><strong>4. A deadline that’s at least two weeks out.</strong> It takes time for an agency to craft a thoughtful response to your RFP, so make sure you leave enough time in your RFP calendar for that to happen. Two weeks tends to be sufficient, but more time is always better. I’ve received RFP’s due the next day, but since I’m probably busy eating oysters under the DUMBO archway, it’s going to be hard for me to turn that around.</p>
<p><strong>5. Your digits. </strong>Be willing and available to talk about your RFP,&nbsp;at least for a few minutes over the phone. Blasting it out and only having real conversations after you’ve received proposals can be like going on a blind date and expecting the other person to show up with an engagement ring. Even more ideal? We’ve chatted before you distribute the RFP.</p>

Maybe even independence!","Dan Gunderman","1111","","<p>On September 18, 2014, Scotland will be voting in a referendum to determine whether it will become an independent nation. As of a month ago, when I was in Scotland, the YES (pro-independence) campaign looked destined for certain loss. The polls had remained largely stagnant for months.&nbsp;</p>","<p>On September 18, 2014, Scotland will be voting in a referendum to determine whether it will become an independent nation. As of a month ago, when I was in Scotland, the YES (pro-independence) campaign looked destined for certain loss. The polls had remained largely stagnant for months.</p>
<p>Then, this past weekend, a new poll put the YES vote ahead for the first time. In other words, as I write this, it’s suddenly too close to call. So what happened?</p>
<p>Let’s ignore whether independence is a good idea. The Ducks that are paying attention don’t even agree with one another. But what I will say is that the YES campaign has been doing a much better job with its messaging than the NO campaign.</p>
<p>As a messaging exercise, YES has a clear advantage in some ways. YES is an inherently positive idea. NO is inherently negative. The NO campaign has called itself “Better Together” to compensate. YES has been YES and only YES.</p>
<p>And YES has built on that by being relentlessly positive from the beginning. You can see what I mean by visiting <a href=""http://www.yesScotland.net/"">their official website</a> or checking out <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YesScotland"">their Facebook page</a>. Positive posts far outnumber the negative ones. They’ve also let their supporters embrace the YES campaign in their own ways: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GreenYes2014"">Greens for YES</a>. <a href=""http://www.womenforindependence.org/"">Women for Independence</a>. <a href=""https://twitter.com/ItalianScots"">Italian-Scots for Si</a>. They can define what an independent Scotland means to them in their own terms. The excitement in all of these groups is palpable and infectious.</p>
<p>On the other side, <a href=""http://bettertogether.net/"">Better Together</a> (or “No, thanks”) dominates with messages of risk and fear. It’s fascinating. It’s called Better Together, but Worse Apart might be more accurate, and you can see it in their website. They haven’t expressed a positive vision for what the United Kingdom might look like in the future for Scotland. Instead it’s the feeling of separation anxiety: however things are in Scotland now, it would only be worse as an independent nation.</p>
<p>In the last few days, after the devastating poll, Better Together has tried to improve its message, offering a vision of what it might look like to give Scotland some additional powers without granting full independence (sometimes called DevoMax, or a souped up version of devolution). Unfortunately for them, the different parties that control Westminster don’t agree on what DevoMax looks like, so they’re still not getting a positive message out. At least not a consistent one.</p>
<p>And DevoMax at this point is a hard sell anyway, since the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond originally asked for that to be an option on the independence ballot, which Prime Minister David Cameron refused to grant. It was to be full independence or nothing on the ballot.</p>
<p>I tend to think it’s the relentless positivity around their vision for Scotland that’s put YES within reach of Better Together. A huge swath of the population is still undecided, and they appear to be breaking overwhelmingly toward YES. A positive vision is something that people want to be a part of.</p>
<p>And this is something that nonprofits can learn from. What might the world look like if you succeed? How can you define your exciting, positive vision for the future in a way that’s sure to build excitement and support, even if it takes time?</p>
<p>I have no idea how the Scots will vote on September 18. But I’m seriously impressed with how the YES campaign has been able to focus people’s minds on what Scotland has the potential to be. Win or lose the vote next week, there are now thousands and thousands of people motivated to make it so. That seems like a win to me.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1409%2","Lessons in messaging from Scotland","Dan Gunderman takes a look at the YES campaign for Scottish independence, exploring how the positivity inherent in the YES campaign's messaging, website, social media presence, and more is giving it legs and inspiring support.

<p>How can a nonprofit organization expect to create a campaign that stands out when there are so many campaigns—often backed by considerably larger budgets—happening on any given day? Often, a simple, memorable concept can be just the thing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you’re a New York City subway commuter, <a href=""http://democratify.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Airbnb-3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">you've probably noticed the Airbnb ad campaign “New Yorkers agree. Airbnb is great for NYC.”</a> plastered all over subway stations, featuring personal stories of hosts who benefit from the extra income of renting out their home. The campaign was rolled out at the same time that the company was in a legal conflict with the New York Attorney General. I can only hypothesize (since I don’t work for the company) that the goal of the campaign was to convince New Yorkers to believe that they are a valuable resource for the city, in the midst of opposing views from certain government institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">“New Yorkers agree. Airbnb is great for NYC,”</span><span data-mce-mark=""1""> shows the power of a strong campaign concept—when you have a clear, simple, unified lens through which to tell your campaign story, it will make a memorable impression, and hopefully have the effect you want, like inspiring a donation or getting another vote. </span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">A concept name, unified visual look (fonts, colors, photos) and compelling, relevant messages (copy lines, call to actions, etc.) can tie the concept together, leaving your target audiences with a consistent impression. </span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">The best campaign concepts have “legs”—they can play out</span><span data-mce-mark=""1""> across different channels like email, direct mail, web, print ads, and social media.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Lets look at another example, just for fun:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The organization: The MTA. Campaign goal: Convince subway riders to be patient with construction and promise that their subway experience will get better with time by giving riders an “inside look” at the improvements being made. Campaign concept: “Improving, nonstop.” It's a smart and simple concept. Who wouldn’t love a nonstop subway ride to their destination? &nbsp;Who wouldn’t want a transit system that keeps getting better? The concept helps communicate a simple message to New Yorkers: please be patient, we’re working on it!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/2/a06c2f0ac486e0e347c929331a884abc/files/_resized/80_600_400_smith_9f49.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""400"" /></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Coming up with a successful campaign concept for a nonprofit isn’t easy. You need to decide on a goal (like raising money) and a specific objective (say, $100,000 by the end of the calendar year), to identify your key audiences for the campaign (who are those people most likely to donate to your organization this year), and then to determine the core message or idea that will influence these people to support your campaign. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Big Duck has had the pleasure of working with Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) for a number of years on their annual fundraising campaign. <a href=""/parent-project-muscular-dystrophy-year-end-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">A couple years ago, we created a concept for their campaign</a> to demonstrate their leadership in the fight against Duchenne, and to inspire their supporters to keep believing and working towards a cure. <a href=""/parent-project-muscular-dystrophy-year-end-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">We called the concept “It’s Possible"" — a simple and powerful rallying cry for people impacted by the disorder.</a> We carried out this concept across a number of channels—direct mail, an email series, social media, and their website. All the materials featured the campaign concept, while sharing real stories of people involved in the fight to help reinforce the message of possibility.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">By no means should or could your campaign communicate everything about your organization. This is where we see a lot of nonprofits get stuck. Nonprofits often want to say everything they possibly can about how impressive their work is in a single campaign, rather than boiling it down to one or two compelling ideas.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1""></span>Oftentimes nonprofits launch campaigns with very ambitious goals—like raising money or recruiting new participants for a program—but they miss an opportunity to use a clear, guiding campaign concept to shape the work. Without a defined concept, a campaign can leave audiences feeling uninspired, or unclear and confused about what they should think, or what action they should take. Even if all of the ideas in your campaign are strong, overwhelming the audience with too many unintegrated or visually disparate ideas will turn them off, and tune you out.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">And with that, I’m off to wait for the F train.</span></p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1067%2,1413%3,1409%4","The importance of an effective campaign concept","Every successful campaign--whether it be an awareness, a fundraising, or a recruitment campaign--relies on its central concept to guide that campaign's messaging, visuals, and goals.

Inviting someone into your home can be tricky, but the benefits can far outweigh any potential hiccups. To help keep these relationships as productive as possible, here are three tips to keep in mind as you begin any work with outside parties.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div>1. Set expectations</div>
<div>When working with an outside party for the first time, it's crucial that both sides set expectations. What do you expect to get out of this relationship? Is there a certain way your organization works that your freelancer absolutely must keep in mind when jumping onto projects? If you make sure to share any necessary information&nbsp;<i>before&nbsp;</i>issues arise, things will get done more quickly and with less conflict. Everyone wins.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Be the content expert</div>
<div>No matter how versed in your organization's mission or work a freelancer or consultant may be, you will always be the content expert. Freelancers and consultants rely on that. The parties you work with may be experts in their fields, but it's impractical to expect them to be immediate experts on the things your organization spends day in and day out working on. This is actually a positive--your consultant or freelancer can bring an invaluable outsider perspective, just be sure to leverage any input with your specific, deep understanding of your own work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Don't forget the ""why""</div>
<div>It's to be expected that a consultant or freelancer might sometimes miss the mark. We rely on our clients to point us in the right direction when we get it wrong, so explaining to us what went wrong will require some education. The most useful bit of feedback a freelancer or consultant can get is they ""why""--why didn't that logo resonate with you? Why does the language here feel a bit off? That guidance will be the most fruitful.&nbsp;</div>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","","","","","","","","",

You hire someone to come in and repaint it, but when they begin to examine the damage, they discover the real problem: the wall isn't structurally sound. You need to rebuild before you can repaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see this story unfold again and again when we work with organizations to examine and refine their brands (especially through our brandraising assessment process, which involves deeper and more thoughtful research). We think we're here to paint, but it turns out there are bigger issues to be addressed before we begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions that can hold back your brand</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the key questions we commonly encounter that need to be resolved before we can start thinking about logos and taglines and messaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your organization's biggest opportunities (in terms of fundraising, programs, advocacy, etc.)? Where do you have the best chance to grow, and whom should you target to get there?</li>
<li>What need do you fulfill? Are you sure that need exists?</li>
<li>What makes you different from other organizations in your space? What's the special sauce that sets you apart?</li>
<li>Are you pursuing your mission effectively? Are all the programs you're offering the right ones, and are they successful? If not, what programs should be eliminated or changed?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how do you tackle these issues?</strong></p>
<p>These are big, tough questions, and there aren't any easy answers. They cut deeper than branding, and they usually require board-level conversations, expert facilitation, and additional research to resolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, we recommend that an organization try to resolve these issues before beginning a branding exercise. It's hard to brand successfully when there's lack of alignment about the big picture. How can you expect to choose an appropriate tagline or write a new mission statement if you're not on the same page about why you exist? It's a theme that emerged in <a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">our recent study about the effects of rebranding</a>—nonprofit staff reported that a new focus or strategic plan was a key factor in the success of a new brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if a full strategic planning process isn't in the cards, you'll at least want to initiate conversations with your leadership about some of these issues. A good, thoughtful branding process is going to surface them anyway—and the better prepared you are to tackle them, the more smoothly the work will go.</p>
<p><strong>Can't we just figure it out later?</strong></p>
<p>If you paint over the cracks in that wall, it will look a lot better in the short term—but the structural problem hasn't been resolved, and eventually, it's going to fall down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strong brand is a clear expression of who you already are. It's not going to correct structural flaws, and it's not in and of itself a process of reinvention. The reinvention needs to happen first—and then you can go to work creating a brand that powerfully and effectively communicates the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you're thinking about rebranding and you haven't recently gone through strategic planning or other thoughtful examination of your organization's strategy, get ready to tackle some big questions first. It's the right way to make sure your brand—and your organization—are as strong and successful as possible.</p>

We asked their Media Librarian, Keira Dempsey, to discuss the tools she uses and the insights she has into creating and maintaining a great media library.</em></p>
<p>In 2006 I joined <a href=""http://plan-international.org"" target=""_blank"">child rights organization Plan International</a> as their Media Librarian. On my first day, I was shown a cupboard full of DVDs, CDs and tapes and told to ""make us a library."" It was a challenge, but it’s actually nice to start a library from scratch rather than having to follow someone else’s pre-organized structure – which can sometimes be rather curious, to say the least.</p>
<p>The Digital Asset Management (DAM) system Plan was using was a bit of a dinosaur; we needed to make a change. I looked to other NGOs for inspiration and quickly saw that a lot of them were using <a href=""http://www.resourcespace.org/"">ResourceSpace</a> – open source DAM software originally developed for Oxfam. One look and I knew this was a great system, certainly the best I had ever used in my 20 years as a media librarian.</p>
<p>While the success of any media library obviously relies in large part on the software, having a great system is just one side of the coin. The other invaluable asset is employing someone who knows what they are doing to manage the site on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>So often, organizations invest in a system and then bring in a temp for a short time to get the site up and running. This approach underestimates how much time and effort it takes to maintain and manage the content. Leaving the uploading of new assets to whoever has a bit of spare time and ignoring all those cataloguing rules we librarians love can turn the best system into a mess that only gets worse.</p>
<p>Our new library site was launched in March 2010 and we’ve seen a fantastic response; during the first year, approximately 60 people were logging on each day. Four years on, we’re getting around 200 users daily, and over 1,300 Plan staff members have accounts.</p>
<p>Eight years after joining Plan, I think the library I worked to create does provide a brilliant service to a lot of people. It also saves our organization money; our 70 offices around the world can share their multimedia assets with one another, limiting the amount of money we have to put into acquiring new pieces. The original investment we made—in the software and in my (extensive) time setting up the new system—has paid off.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that my job is complete, but looking at my inbox I can tell you that 120 new photos have just been uploaded from the Dominican Republic… so I’d better crack on.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2063%1","Managing and organizing media files ","","","digital asset management tools and software tips","media photography ","media library archive system software website online clients","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a data-rapid_p=""33"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kulturarvsprojektet/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to DRs  Kulturarvsprojekt's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">DRs Kulturarvsprojekt</a></p>

<p>LinkedIn is all about connecting with others who share commonality. This, of course, can be said of all social networks, but if you want to maximize your&nbsp;<em>professional&nbsp;</em>network, building a personal brand is essential.</p>
<p>Most nonprofit leaders make the mistake of waiting to build a profile when they need it, but the best time to build a profile is now. Additionally, it should be an ongoing “campaign” of networking so when you need a specific connection, your network is ready and waiting. Tommy Spaulding, author of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-Just-Know-Relationships/dp/0307589137""><em>It’s Not Just Who You Know</em></a>, calls it “netgiving” rather than networking. This is a terrific approach to building your LinkedIn profile. Try reaching out to your initial contacts by looking for ways you can help others, rather than the “connect-with-me-because-I-need-you” approach.</p>
<p>How do we effectively build a brand? Let’s consult&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brandraising-Nonprofits-Visibility-Through-Communications/dp/0470527536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275934894&amp;sr=1-1""><em>Brandraising: How Nonprofits Raise Visibility and Money Through Smart Communications</em></a>.

<p>Here are seven steps to building a better profile:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Picture your contacts in the room</strong>. Picture yourself in a meeting and introduce yourself similarly on LinkedIn. Sarah Durham talks about “audience-centric communications” in her book. The same rules apply here. Write in your voice as if you were talking directly to someone in the room. Don’t cut and paste your resume.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What is your tagline?</strong>&nbsp;The line of text under your name is the first thing people see in your profile. It follows your name in search hit lists. It’s your brand. Try to distill your professional personality into a more eye-catching phrase. Durham recommends making a short list of organizations similar to yours and, if your tagline could apply to them as well, keep working at it until it’s specific to your nonprofit. The same rule can be applied to your tagline on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Make your summary section work for you.</strong>&nbsp;Put yourself back into the meeting room and think about your elevator pitch when you introduce yourself. This blurb goes in the summary box to engage your readers. You have five to 10 seconds to capture your reader’s attention. Durham discusses the importance of developing a messaging platform in the identity level of her brandraising model. The messaging that you create about yourself should include an introduction, key messages about you and, of course, the elevator pitch. Use elements of the messaging platform throughout your profile to build a more impactful impression.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Specialties = SEO</strong>. Think of the Specialties field as your personal search engine optimizer, a way to refine the ways people find and remember you. This is where your social sector buzzwords belong. Personal values you bring to your professional performance and humor or passion always add more personalization. Durham explains a fun exercise in her book when you need to isolate the personality of your brand: Ask what mascot could represent you. When you land on the answer, think of words that describe that mascot. These words will help you pinpoint what personality you want to convey in your profile.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Chunking copy helps</strong>. When you explain your experience, break down each company or nonprofit you’ve worked for into visual segments or chunks with a short description about what the company does. Make it easy to read and consistently formatted.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Improve your Google page rank.</strong>&nbsp;Pat your own back and others’. Get recommendations from colleagues, clients and employers who can speak credibly about your abilities or performance. Think quality over quantity. According to Durham, your messaging platform is shared with board members and staff so everyone is consistently sharing the same message about your organization, thereby building a consistent and more powerful brand. In the case of your LinkedIn profile, your connections are your message carriers so make sure your tagline, summary and additional information fields portray your brand (and personality). Chances are they will reference your profile to make the recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Build your unique brand.&nbsp;</strong>Use the Additional Information section to round out your profile with a few key interests. Add websites that showcase your abilities or passions. Then edit the default “My Website” label to encourage click-throughs (you get Google page rankings for those, raising your visibility). If you belong to a trade association or interest group, help other members find you by naming that group. Awards, recognition by peers, customers and employers add prestige without bragging by listing them here. This strategy looks much like what Durham might call your “experiential level” of brandraising, because this level is where your potential supporters or, in this case, connections may find you. Try to optimize the number of channels in which you can reach people by referencing your affiliations and acknowledgements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, make sure your LinkedIn profile link is on your email signature, website and blog. Now, start “netgiving.”</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,2063%2,1412%3","Using brandraising model on social media","This blog post from CausePlanet uses Sarah Durham's brandraising approach to build a great LinkedIn profile that appeals to your network, represents you well both professionally and personally, and can help you advance your career.","","branding your linkedin page to get the right attention","socialmedia brandraising linkedin audience","socialmedia brandraising linkedin audience branding brand facebook ","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a data-rapid_p=""23"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/sheilascarborough/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Sheila Scarborough's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">Sheila Scarborough</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p>The great people at <a href=""http://trust.guidestar.org/2013/09/04/online-funding-101-fundraising-for-nonprofits-and-campaigns/"" target=""_blank"">Guidestar</a> and <a href=""http://www.fundraising123.org/fundraising"" target=""_blank"">Network for Good</a> have compiled some excellent resources for beginners. You should take a look at those, you know, after reading my tips.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make the case to give to your nonprofit compelling. </strong>There are a lot of nonprofits out there, many of whom share a similar mission. Why should a donor give to your organization? What makes you different or better? What will you do with that donation and what results can you offer and share? Bonus: Not sure where to start? <a href=""/big-duck-blog-how-to-make-your-nonprofit-stand-out"" target=""_parent"">See </a><a href=""/big-duck-blog-how-to-make-your-nonprofit-stand-out"" target=""_parent"">what Sarah has to say about this book by Tom Ahern</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make online giving easy. </strong>Finding your donate button should be obvious, and it should be located in the same place throughout your site. Once the donor gets to the donation page, it should be simple and easy. Bonus: Get inspired by this <a href=""https://services.grist.org/give/?campaign=responsive-large-menu"" target=""_blank"">wonderful example of a donation page from Grist</a> and try these <a href=""http://donordigital.com/2013/02/kick-start-your-donation-page-optimization-efforts-test-these-7-emerging-techniques/"" target=""_blank"">donation page optimization tips from Donordigital</a>.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Make online giving a trustworthy experience</strong><strong>.</strong> Use a reputable donation processing tool or Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system and make sure that what the donor sees on the donation page is similar to what she might see on the thank you screen, email acknowledgment, and even her receipt. If possible, have trust and verification seals on the page. Bonus: <a href=""http://idealware.org/reports/consumers-guide-donor-management-systems"">Compare options for donor management systems</a> in this handy report by Idealware or <a href=""http://www.nten.org/articles/2012/tools-to-improve-your-online-fundraising"">read more about online fundraising tools</a> over on the NTEN blog.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Make online giving enjoyable.</strong> Say thank you right away and follow-up. Some organizations send two emails after a gift—the&nbsp;immediate receipt and one that comes a little later with a more personal message of thanks. Others call the donor or send a handwritten note. People give because it feels good. Keep them feeling good beyond the first ask and you’ll have a much better chance at getting them to give again. (See, retention is still on my mind!) Bonus: <a href=""http://www.clairification.com/2014/09/21/3-rules-thanking-nonprofit-donors-never-broken/"">Follow these rules for thanking donors</a> by Claire Axelrad.

Major gifts are on your mind, </span><span>but you also have a million other things on your plate (like finalizing that annual fund letter you’ve been work on all week). </span></p>
<p>You need to be ready the next time your board member calls about a strong prospect for a major gift, but you're not sure where to start.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here's a six step game plan to help you seize the moment, and get in shape for a successful major donor meeting—while keeping the rest of your fundraising machine on the move. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span></span><strong>1. Gather the facts.</strong> Fundraisers should always remember that giving is more about the donor than it is about the organization. With that in mind, the more you know about your prospect before the meeting, the better. So do a little research first. What other causes does this person care about? How familiar are they about the issues you tackle? How much do they know about what your work? Are they a more analytical giver, driven by evidence and numbers, or a more emotional giver, inspired by success stories that tug at the heartstrings? Try to have answers to some of these questions so you can make a stronger connection to your donor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2. Plan your case.</strong>&nbsp;Once you’ve done your research, think about the story you will tell about your organization to your prospect in a way that feels specific and timely. Consider what challenges and needs your organization has right now, what projects and initiatives you’re working on to tackle these challenges, and—most importantly—how this person can play an important role in advancing your work forward. At Big Duck, <a href=""/big-duck-blog-need-a-clear-message-focus-on-the-musts"" target=""_blank"">we help our clients improve their messaging</a><a href=""/big-duck-blog-need-a-clear-message-focus-on-the-musts""><span>—</span></a>we work on finding the most effective and accessible ways to talk about an organization’s work to their key audiences. For communications with major donors, it’s key that you have language ready to go that makes a strong and timely case for support.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span></span><strong>3. Know how much you’re asking for (and if you’re even asking.)</strong> Deciding how much you’re asking for takes a good deal of strategy. Should you low-ball it—ask for a smaller gift first to get your foot in the door? Or be more ambitious— ask for a higher gift with the expectation that the donor might first say no. There’s some classic sociological research that debates the merits of both strategies. Google “Door-in-the-face technique” if you’re interested in learning more. And remember—major donor fundraising is all about asking for the right gift, to the right person, at the right time. You might find that it’s best to cultivate your donors a while before making the ask.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>4. Assemble your team.</strong>&nbsp;</span>Who’s doing the talking? While members of your Development team or your Executive Director may be your organization’s most experienced fundraisers, it’s worthwhile to think about what other points of view this donor may be interested in hearing. Perhaps a staff member who is leading an interesting new program who can help them to understand the impact your work is having by telling a compelling success story.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>5. Gather the right stuff.</strong>&nbsp;</span>At the end of any major donor meeting, your prospect should walk away with some materials to flip through to learn more about you, and help to fill in any blanks from the meeting. We like to call it a “leave-behind”—ideally a printed piece that leaves a strong impression about your work, and makes a case for support. <a href=""http://hi.bigducknyc.com/acton/attachment/4852/f-0060/1/-/-/-/-/Sharsheret%20Impact%20Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Check out this impact report Big Duck worked on with Sharsheret, a supportive resource for Jewish women and families facing cancer,</a> in honor of their 13th anniversary.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>6. Keep your prospect in the loop.</strong> Incorporate your prospect as a regular and carefully handled segment of your ongoing communications. If you have an newsletter or regular email series, be sure to add them to the list so that your prospect has even more chances to learn about you, and see all the exciting work you’re doing.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2013, it dawned on me that Big Duck, the business I founded in June 1994 and still run, was on the cusp of its 20<sup>th</sup> birthday. It had been an unusually challenging year at work, and I’d had a few personally difficult years, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“How should we celebrate?” my intrepid Vice President, Farra Trompeter, asked me. Without thinking, I blurted out, “I’d like to take a sabbatical”.&nbsp; My knee-jerk reaction got me thinking… Did I really need a break that badly? Or was it just a good time to take a step back and let others step forward?</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Farra and I talked more about it. What would it take for me, as CEO, to step away for a bit? How long was realistic? What opportunities or challenges could that afford Big Duck’s staff?</p>
<p>By February, we were both convinced it was do-able, and the dates were agreed on. &nbsp;Farra graciously agreed to take on a few of my primary responsibilities, as did other members of our staff. I set about identifying all the areas and tasks that would need to be managed by others in my absence, thinking about who could do what, training them, and handing over the reins.</p>
<p>My day-to-day activities were dispersed across five people to avoid unduly taxing any one person. I worked to set up whatever I could in the months preceding my sabbatical so others wouldn’t have to take on more than was absolutely necessary. That meant a lot of planning, proactive communicating, and pondering. Along the way, I learned a lot: what I really do that nobody else does, and what it really takes to set up others for success months in advance. If you’d asked me, I might have told you I always try to set up Big Duck for long-term, sustainable success. But doing so in the context of me not being around for a few months sparked an entirely new perspective on what that could mean.</p>
<p>Walking away from a business you started, run, and have thought about daily for 20 years doesn’t sound easy, especially when you still love it all. But for me, it actually was easy to take a break, because Big Duck’s staff are so wholly capable and committed, and the business is happily stable. Discussing what was likely to happen— and exploring worst-case scenarios— also really helped my peace of mind and others’ sense of preparation. In advance, we agreed on how any crises would be handled, and what they should contact me about or just manage directly.</p>
<p>By August 15, my autoresponder was set to notify people who emailed me that I was away until November 1, listing the Ducks who could be contacted in my absence, and noting that any emails would be automatically archived and not read by me. My work phone number was set to auto-forward, too. I was officially off the professional grid for the first time since the Internet was invented.</p>
<p>While I was away, I spent time reflecting on work without feeling distracted by the usual to-do items and responsibilities. I had time to think about what I love about Big Duck, and what I should do differently as its leader. I took time to do a lot of things I rarely get time to do, and relished the sense of flexibility and lack of responsibility that came with it. I wondered how things were going, but I didn’t worry. If anything, I hoped my staff were taking advantage of the opportunity to be more entrepreneurial and explore their own leadership skills more deeply without me getting in their way. About half of the way through it, I found myself looking forward to coming back, seeing everyone, and tackling things with my newfound perspective.</p>
<p>When I came back, just shy of three months later, I was completely impressed and not at all surprised by what I found. The staff had not only kept things going, they’d advanced new ideas and projects, and stayed totally focused on our shared business objectives. &nbsp;I was refreshed and renewed, and felt clearer than I have in years about where and how I should be spending my time at work. In 2015, I anticipate we’ll be launching a few new initiatives that are the product of my having had the time and space to look at the business from new angles. It was also clear that if I’d stayed away longer, things would have been fine, which has helped make it easier than ever for me to let go and trust my team. &nbsp;I hope that’s a lesson I don’t unlearn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d asked me months ago, I might have said that taking a sabbatical was selfishly motivated. And it was, in that I got a lot from it personally. But in hindsight, the opportunities it afforded all of us to redefine how we work together, shift and share responsibilities, and examine our own leadership skills turned out to be significant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also been interesting to see how many people are curious about what it means, as the CEO of a small business, to take a sabbatical. It’s made me feel that there is a much greater need for leaders of institutions of all kinds to take periods of time to step away, and for others to step in. I’m looking forward to hearing your questions, comments, and insights on this subject- feel free to share them with me in the comments.</p>

The point of having it is to invite your audience to hop on in and take a journey that inspires them to donate, volunteer, or spread the word.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All too often we find at Big Duck that organizations who have developed a strong brand aren’t sure what they need to do to take that brand out for a spin, much less strategically map out an inspiring journey for their audiences.</p>
<p>We've found that taking a moment to develop a strategic two- to four-year supporter engagement plan can offer the road map your team needs to get the most out of your brand. Here at Big Duck, <a href=""/services"" target=""_parent"">we keep our process relatively simple:</a> we start with a light research and fact-finding phase, then write a plan that includes clear goals for each of the coming years, strategies to achieve them, priorities for how to allocate communications resources strategically each year, and a high-level calendar and content strategy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However you decide to capture your plan, there are some common big opportunities for getting more mileage out of your brand that we've noticed. If you’re thinking about how to get more fundraising, recruitment or list-building return from your communications (and let's face it, who's not?), here are some opportunities you might want to make sure you’re not missing:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Have you chosen a destination wisely?</strong> <strong>And does the whole team know what it is? </strong>Hopefully, you have developed your brand with goals in mind: to increase fundraising, to differentiate yourself from other organizations, to recruit a new kind of supporter. The risk here is in either losing sight of those goals, or simply expecting your team to achieve them 100% the week after your brand roll-out. To find a productive medium, set milestones for the fundraising, engagement, and list-growth gains you want to achieve each year that are grounded in industry norms for growth, the lifecycle of your program, and the time and money you are investing in communications. Make sure these goals are accessible to your whole team, and report back on at least a monthly basis on how your communications are stacking up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><strong>Do you have on-ramps for new supporters?</strong> We see that many organizations can be so focused on the end-goal—say, high-dollar fundraising—that they don't build any communications or low-bar actions into their calendar that will help new prospects get ready for making that first gift. Either as a part of each one of your communications campaigns, or as an annual campaign in it's own right, try to look for creative ways to let prospects engage at lower levels. It can be all too easy to forget to make room in your calendar for the caption contests, advocacy actions, or photo campaigns that can inspire a new supporter who's not quite ready to give, but you'll pay the price down the road with dwindling prospect pools.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Are you encouraging existing supporters to put on the gas? </strong>It would be wonderful if your existing supporters knew to engage at higher levels automatically, but sadly they will need a bit of an extra nudge. When you're planning your campaigns for the year, try to think about crafting more ambitious calls to action for existing supporters. You could ask repeat donors for a monthly gift, rather than a one-time donation. Or ask high-dollar givers to make a stretch gift to hit a campaign goal. You'll need time to craft these ""upgrade"" calls to action specifically for donors, so make sure your team knows this is a priority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><strong>Do you know what opportunities you should be seizing along the way? </strong>&nbsp;The communications opportunities you seize can often say a lot about you. Want people to see you as more than a disaster relief organization? Then don't just send out emergency appeals. Want people to understand your positive, optimistic brand? Then make sure you are touting victories as well as threats for your mission. The key is to make sure your team knows what kinds of news and opportunities to prioritize in your communications calendar, and what kind of content to develop. One organization even developed a decision tree for the kinds of news to respond to and now as a team resource. Smart!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Are you making time for team maintenance?</strong> As you take your brand out for a spin, make sure you are building time for the check-ins, report-backs and review cycles that can keep your internal team inspired and engaged. Have you started establishing a pattern of annual campaigns planning meetings with your team members? Monthly reports to programs staff? These regular opportunities to coordinate and educate your team take care and feeding, but can add momentum to your team's communications journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">And how about you?

<p dir=""ltr"">We spoke to Thomas Kurmann, Director of Development at Doctors Without Borders, to learn more about what makes their approach unique, what resonates with donors, and how they manage to keep their staff “on message.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Big Duck:</strong> What makes Doctors Without Borders different from other humanitarian aid organizations?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Thomas Kurmann, Doctors Without Borders:</strong> It is probably the mix of different ingredients that makes us (and other actors) unique. Doctors Without Borders has grown its expertise in the field of humanitarian and medical assistance over more than 40 years. Our mission is driven by the humanitarian principles of independence, impartiality and neutrality. The decision to intervene in a context or not, is driven exclusively by the extent of suffering and medical assistance needed by a certain population. We are action oriented on the one hand and have the flexibility and capacity to intervene quickly in whatever emergency situation our medical assistance is needed most. This is made possible by our financial independence, which is grounded in the fact that, globally speaking, 90 percent of our funds are coming from private donors. No other international NGO has such an extensive proportion of private support. And on the other hand, we speak out publicly on and denounce situations, whenever we think that we can improve the access to medical assistance through our public communication and advocacy. We intervene in crisis situations, where other actors do not have the capacity or capability to act.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Big Duck: </strong>What perceptions do you want your donors to have of you?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Thomas:</strong> We know that our donors perceive us as an emergency medical organization first and foremost. It is important that donors understand the principles that drive our interventions and decisions. We have strong accountability systems in place, inform transparently on crisis situations we intervene on, but also on the challenges we are facing. Having our principles and values communicated to our supporters is crucial in terms of strengthening our identity in the perception of our supporters. We want them to partner with us and understand why certain (difficult) choices sometimes have to be made, such as our <a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/country-region/somalia"">departure from Somalia</a>, for example.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Big Duck: </strong>What motivates your donors to give?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Thomas:</strong> It is the character of an emergency organization that drives people mainly to donate to Doctors Without Borders. The fact that we move quickly when an emergency happens and get things done. It is mainly the proximity to the field, the patient stories, expressed through the lens of our aid workers, that are most inspiring to our donors. But also our honesty and transparency, when it comes to communicating challenging situations. We stick to our values and <a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/about-us/history-principles/charter"">principles</a> in a consistent way.</p>
<p><strong>Big Duck: </strong>Is it important for Doctors Without Borders to communicate consistently to your donors? What advice do you have for other nonprofits that struggle with communicating with a unified voice?</p>
<p><strong>Thomas, Doctors without Borders:</strong> Doctors Without Borders is a movement of independent entities around the world, which is sometimes challenging when it comes to speaking out with one voice. The driver to remain consistent is grounded in the fact that we speak out only on what we witness directly ourselves in the field and is considered relevant. We remain focused on the suffering of our patients and their stories. Spokespeople of the organization are mainly aid workers, who can speak from their own experiences in the field. This gives credibility to the messaging and inspires trust within the audience. We do have a training procedure in place. This allows aid workers to feel comfortable when speaking in the public domain. As an advice, as simple as it might be, I could only say to ground the messaging in the core values of an organization, to be truthful to its own mission in any single step of a communication chain. It is crucial to have clear guidelines in place that describe the roles, responsibilities and relevance of those people who speak on behalf of the organization.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1409%2,1408%3","A conversation with Doctors without Borders","Big Duck had the opportunity to chat with Director of Development at Doctors without Borders, the international medical aid organization, on how they appeal to donors with their transparency, effectiveness, and values.","","international health organization on brand identity","brandraising values brand identity","brandraising values brand health messaging identity transparency","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to opensource.com's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""24"">opensource.com</a>&nbsp;(adapted)</p>",

If you donate to nonprofits, your inbox is probably on fire.

(In fact, last year many <a href=""http://www1.networkforgood.org/digitalgivingindex"" target=""_blank"">nonprofits received 30% of their funds from individuals in December—with ten percent coming in the last three days of the year</a>!)

<p>Truth be told, <a href=""/blog-12-ways-to-make-your-multichannel-campaign-stand-out"">I’m a fan of the multichannel campaign approach</a> where you develop a strong campaign with a consistent theme and apply it across a number of communications channels: direct mail, website, social media, video, in-person events, and yes, email. Multichannel campaigns work best when you focus on the reader/listener (aka “audience”) and reinforce the same message tailored to what works best for each channel. For this training, I focused on what you can to do improve how you use email to renew support from existing donors and perhaps even attract donations from prospects. I was also happy to share the emails from a year-end fundraising campaign we managed last year for <a href=""http://www.curesma.org"" target=""_blank"">Cure SMA</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to the treatment and cure of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the number one genetic cause of death for infants.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Leadership transitions can be a time of uncertainty for all companies. In the case of nonprofits, the challenges of dealing with such transitions are often exacerbated, since they can involve the departure of the organization’s founder, or a high-profile representative.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The communications department has a key role to play in navigating the process of waving goodbye to one leader and welcoming another. While identifying how your organization will communicate externally and internally is important, ensuring that you retain consistent and familiar branding, and working to get buy-in from a new Executive Director regarding your communications strategy, can be key in surviving the inevitable tumult which accompanies leadership transitions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here are some helpful tips on how your communications team can help make sure the introduction of a new leader runs smoothly, and that your ongoing work of raising funds and doing good can continue without pause:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Make sure people know how to talk about the transition.</strong><span> Everybody within your organization should be able to clearly communicate the nature and timing of the leadership transition to current and prospective partners, members and donors. It’s probably a quirk of human psychology, but the inability of staff to coherently explain the transition to an external contact may carry more weight than any number of positive press releases. Engaging your staff early on in the process will enable you to answer any questions, keep staff informed of the transition timetable and respond to any internal concerns prior to disclosing the news publicly.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>But don’t be too eager to talk about it.</strong> </span><span>While staff, board and certain key donors will be keenly interested in the leadership transition, it’s likely that, in most cases, your general donors will care significantly less! While it may be tempting to advertise the leadership transition widely, be wary of causing email fatigue by inundating members with news that may have little relevance to them.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Be consistent.</strong><span> The onboarding of a new leader can be disruptive to the established ways of doing things - indeed, this may be one of the key drivers for the change! - but retaining consistency of message during the transition is of paramount importance. While the inclination may be to accompany a new leader with a hurriedly-revamped communications structure, the likely result of this will be to confuse and potentially alienate your audience. While communications should never be allowed to go stale, a regular and unfluctuating approach to messaging will help avoid confusion among your audiences. </span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Get on the same page as soon as possible.</strong><span> Often new leaders will want to make their mark right away, and one of the most visible ways of doing this is through changes to your organization’s visual identity. It’s important that the communications department walk the new leader through the strategy which underpins the elements of the brand, including tracing the steps taken to identify the fundamental characteristics of the organization which are reflected in the branding. While there is clearly scope for fresh ideas, your brand ultimately needs to reflect the personality of your organization, otherwise you run the risk of a disconnect between how you see yourself and how you present yourself to your audiences.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is clearly no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with leadership transitions, and each situation will differ, just as the character, profile and working practices of each leader are different. However, by making sure all staff are on the same page about the changes, by maintaining consistency in how you communicate with members, and by engaging with the new leader on the underlying strategy behind your current brand, you put your organization in a strong position to ensure a smooth handover and a positive start to the new leader’s tenure.</span></p>

If you went into that interview and baldly stated, “I’m the best candidate for this job, and you’d be a fool not to hire me,” everyone in the room might think you were a pompous jerk.</p>","<p>Imagine that you have a job interview for a role you know you’d be perfect for. If you went into that interview and baldly stated, “I’m the best candidate for this job, and you’d be a fool not to hire me,” everyone in the room might think you were a pompous jerk.</p>
<p>Still, that’s what you’re trying to convince them. So instead of stating it outright, you might tuck that idea in the back of your head while you interview. You give examples. You demonstrate your knowledge. You show your passion. You do everything you can to reinforce that idea: I’m the best possible candidate, and you’d be a fool not to hire me.</p>
<p>The impression you make determines their attitude toward you, their beliefs about you, and ultimately their behavior toward you moving forward. If you’re successful, you’ll get the job.</p>
<p>This is the power of positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Positioning = what people think about you</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, positioning isn’t what you say about yourself. It’s what people think about you. You can let that happen on its own—or you can shape it. Start with a clear positioning statement.</p>
<p>A positioning statement is an internal tool, and it expresses the big idea you want to own in the minds of your audiences. Maybe it’s something that differentiates you from other organizations in your field, but the important thing is that it’s one idea.</p>
<p>Keeping your positioning statement simple can be difficult, so remember: your audiences are inundated by marketing messages all day long, and nuances about your nonprofit will be completely lost on them.</p>
<p>So it might help if you think of your positioning statement not as the <u>only</u> thing you hope people know about you, but the <u>first</u> thing they think of. Let’s hope all sorts of positive stuff follows that first thought, but positioning is just that first thought.</p>
<p><strong>Why your positioning statement is an internal (not external) tool</strong></p>
<p>There are really two big reasons to think of your positioning statement as internal only:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want the freedom to be a bit boastful (“I’m the best candidate for this job”). You can really only get to a strong positioning statement if you don’t have to worry about offending peers, partners, or competitors.</li>
<li>Your positioning statement is not your messaging. Saying “I’m the greatest” (or whatever your big idea is) does nothing to prove your point. Your messaging platform needs to be more convincing. It should show, not tell.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might land on some language you feel comfortable using publicly in your positioning statement, to be sure, but that’s not the goal. Mostly you’re looking to codify that big idea you want people to think about you.</p>
<p><strong>Using your positioning statement</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve defined and written your positioning statement, pin it above your desk. It’s now your mantra—a sort of mega goal for your communications especially—and you can use it as a gut check when you’re writing, speaking, designing, or reviewing materials someone else has created for you. Does your website support your positioning statement? Are your client interactions reinforcing the idea? Will everyone who comes into contact with you—at your gala or through a year-end appeal or from a brochure—be given the same impression?</p>
<p><strong>Undervalue positioning at your peril</strong></p>
<p>You’re making an impression on people whether you’re being mindful about it or not. If you’re not reinforcing the same, simple, powerful idea about your nonprofit all of the time, a few things could happen (and this is by no means an exhaustive list):</p>
<ol>
<li>Your inconsistent communications will cause people to think you’re a bit of a mess.</li>
<li>You’ll be confused with other organizations doing similar work.</li>
<li>A single negative story in the media will suddenly become the primary association people have about you. Yikes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The power of positioning</strong></p>
<p>Reinforcing the same big idea in the minds of your audiences demonstrates consistency and professionalism. And once people have that primary takeaway about you, it becomes a lot easier to engage them with the rest of your story—maybe even with some of your more nuanced work (and your messaging about it).</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1409%2,1407%3,1067%4","The value of creating a positioning statement","","","what is your organizations big idea","messaging positioning brandraising branding","messaging positioning brandraising branding internal brand","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a data-rapid_p=""34"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/photohannah/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Hannah's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">Hannah</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

Creating mission-centric programs is still central, but as the sector matures, more and more leaders understand that it takes more than just great programs to advance a mission, especially in tougher fundraising climates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see this playing out largely in two areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday's Executive Directors are now increasingly called CEOs, and they are running nonprofits with a sharper focus on communications, development, HR, and more traditionally 'for profit' business-like strategies. In 2015, I expect we'll see that trend continue: increasingly, CEOs understand that&nbsp;communicating well externally requires communicating well internally, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how I think that shakes out: In the past, the focus of communications was almost entirely on ""the stuff that gets sent out."" These days, more nonprofits are (wisely) prioritizing building a team of strong communicators internally, coordinating the messages that donors and other external audiences receive, and building a healthy work culture. That means making sure the right people are hired, giving them better support to build their skills, integrating values into daily decision-making, and working to break down departmental silos and barriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another outgrowth of this more internal, capacity-oriented POV is an increased use of rebranding as a strategy to help align staff internally around how to communicate, and boost revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/rebrandeffect"">Big Duck and FDR Group's 2014 study, ""The Rebrand Effect,""</a> &nbsp;noted that 92% of participating organizations rebranded to communicate more effectively, with fundraising as a leading motivator to do so. 58% of participants have more confidence in their staff's ability to communicate well on behalf of the nonprofit, and to use the new brand to help assess things like the alignment of programs, for examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although many of the participants worked at organizations that had rebranded very recently (in the past two years) and weren't sure what the net gain might be, 50% of participants observed an increase in the revenue of their organization since they rebranded. The research also showed that new leadership and a new strategic plan or focus helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this focus on internal capacity is in the spirit of working smarter, more effectively, and towards the mission. In 2015, I hope we also begin to see a greater alignment between technologies (fundraising software, databases, email service providers, marketing automation software) and people, too. The more leadership, staff, and technologies are aligned, the more effective nonprofits will be at fundraising, communicating effectively, and achieving their missions.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1","Organizational development trends in nonprofits","","","rebranding and internal capacity building to communicate in 2015","rebrand brandraising communications trends internal OD","rebrand brandraising communications trends internal OD strategy development team staff","<p>Image by&nbsp;<span class=""character-name-holder"">zenilorac (Flickr) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",

<p>Ah, the ladder of engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple but compelling idea that your nonprofit will be more successful at gaining (and keeping!) new supporters if you <strong>ask them to engage in quick and easy ways</strong> before asking them to take bigger and more meaningful actions over time.</p>
<p>But what if your mission doesn't naturally lend itself to easier, lower-rung engagement opportunities? <strong>How do keep your ladder of engagement from becoming one intimidating high bar?</strong></p>
<p>Never fear, here are some ideas and inspiration for adding compelling first steps to your ladder of engagement, no matter what your mission is.</p>
<p><strong>First rung: Get their attention, usually by getting them on your list.</strong> At least twice a year, give people an easy, quick way to take action. The trick here is to make it feel both easy <em>and</em> meaningful--either because the action has a clear impact (yup, this is where online advocacy is helpful) or a clear value, like the potential to lead to interesting information, answers, or just a heartfelt way to express your dedication.</p>
<p>In any of these options, make sure you get the most out of it by capturing a small amount of contact information from anyone who takes action, so you can stay in touch. (An email address, a ""like"" on Facebook, an address, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some examples I've found inspiring: The Smithsonian's monthly ""<a href=""http://www.smarterthanacurator.org/"" target=""_blank"">Are you as Smart as a Curator</a>?"" quiz and Fountain House's <a href=""http://fountainhouse.org/unity/signatures/thank_you"" target=""_blank"">open letter supporting young people with mental illness</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second rung: Stay in touch, become top-of-mind.</strong> Once someone is on your list, it will take a while for your organization to become familiar and top-of-mind. If you give them regular ways to see and hear from you, though, they'll be primed and ready to act when your next fundraising appeal rolls around.</p>
<p>And no, you don't have to stay in touch with a big behemoth of a monthly e-newsletter. Try shorter monthly or weekly communications via email, social media, or good old-fashioned snail mail. Just make sure your regular communication offers some way to take action again and gives content your audience will value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some inspiration: <a href=""http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5b63a0823e3b9c105434c46d7&amp;id=d5e2a3cdfe&amp;e=c144a601e0"" target=""_blank"">Daily Good's daily email</a> highlighting projects or campaigns they feel are making the world a better place. And, just 'cause I can't help but brag about my fellow Ducks, Meghan's <a href=""/nonprofit_fundraising_and_marketing_blog?author=&amp;topic=1414&amp;search_term="">Weekly Roundup</a> of nonprofit communications links on our blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third rung: Get them to go public with their support.</strong> Any time you give people a way to take action or use your resources, make sure you encourage them to follow up that action by telling their friends or going public with their support. ""Share"" links and tell-a-friend emails are great ways to do this, but we've seen plenty of innovative share graphics on Facebook, and you could consider printed shareables as well.</p>
<p>Some examples: HRC's <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151530218023281&amp;set=a.10150307206218281.358630.18813753280&amp;type=1"" target=""_blank"">use of Facebook share graphics</a> that let ""likers"" go public with their support of LGBTQ equality and the ""Challenge a friend"" prompt after the <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/actfast/Pages/know-the-signs.aspx"" target=""_blank"">NHS's ""Act FAST"" stroke awareness campaign</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth rung: Get them to make their first donation.</strong> Once someone has joined your list and taken action, getting them to give a first gift is probably your biggest benchmark of success. A welcome series of emails that ends with an appeal is a tried and true way to work new list members up to donating, but there are lots of other ways to target your most promising prospects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some creative tactics: Ask first-time donors to make a very low-level gift of a specific or symbolic amount, like Create Jobs for USA's <a href=""http://www.createjobsforusa.org/"" target=""_blank"">""Indivisible"" wristband $5 ask</a> or the Bronx Zoo's <a href=""http://www.bronxzoo.com/roach/"" target=""_blank"">Valentine's Day Name a Roach</a> for $10 campaign. (That last one is totally worth checking out, trust us.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fifth rung: Get them to give more... or monthly!</strong> If a segment of your list has given before, they've already proven their dedication, so be sure to avoid under-asking!</p>
<p>Ask these donors for at least as much as they've previously given, or encourage them to take the next step and become monthly givers. Segmentation is your friend here--break out these donors and try some creative tactics to get them onto those highest rungs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some interesting examples: When donors gave to the Obama campaign in the 2012 election, they got a follow-up request to chip in a small additional amount soon after. And we've also seen several organizations try following up to recent donors a month after their gift, encouraging them to give a fraction of that amount monthly.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just to think, that's only the beginning!</p>
<p>How are you getting creative to engage supporters across different rungs of the ladder? We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!</p>

Treacherous waters indeed.</p>
<p>But in our experience, the challenge isn’t in whether your report looks fancy enough, or whether it’s printed or online—the real danger is losing sight of what your <i>supporter</i> needs from the report.</p>
<p>To keep yourself grounded (and inspired!) by your supporters' needs, take a cue from author Chip Conley and his <a href=""http://www.peakorganizations.com/peak-perspective/"" target=""_blank"">reimagining of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs for your organization’s audience</a>.</p>
<p>In brief, Conley sees three levels of audience needs: Survival, Success, and Transformation. Here are some questions you might ask at each level in order to stay focused on what matters most to your donor.</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Level 1, Survival. Ask: What does my donor <i>expect</i>?</strong></p>
<p>This may not sound glamorous, but it’s critical to start by asking: Why does my donor actually need an annual report? At the most basic level, it’s an accountability tool, a way for you to report back on how you used their donation, and the difference it made. If you focus on flash but miss out on this critical level of donor stewardship, even the most creative storytelling won’t make up for this lapse.</p>
<p>At this level, double check: Does your report address the supporter directly? Thank them? Acknowledge that donations made the work you describe possible?</p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>Level 2, Success. Ask: What does my donor <i>want</i>?</strong></p>
<p>This is where it gets more interesting. Because hey, a receipt is an accountability tool, but not many people get excited by it. So what would take your report past accountability, to success? At this level, your donors most likely want to feel inspired, appreciated, and like they have a smart perspective on your work. How can you use the story of this year to give that to them?</p>
<p>At this level, double check: Does your report go beyond listing accomplishments to offer a big picture of what this year meant for your mission? Will your donor prefer seeing the report online (because it’s cheaper, more interactive) or in print (more emotional, more tangible)? Do you speak to the importance of the donors’ values and thoughts in addition to their dollars?</p>
<p><strong>Level 3, Transformation. Ask: What needs does my donor not even realize they have?</strong></p>
<p>This is where you can really have fun. Can you surprise your donor by anticipating a need or desire they wouldn’t have expected you to fill? Perhaps you offer a visual perspective on your work that the donor would never expect to see. Or you make sharing the report into an action that actually forwards your organization’s mission. The sky’s the limit—and that’s the point!</p>
<p>At this level, double check: Do you report on the past but also point toward the future? Can you make your report either interactive or personal in a way that adds meaning to the story of this year? Do you have imagery or infographics that would bring your donor along on the journey of this year instead of simply telling it?</p>
<p>How about you? Are there annual report examples that have you inspired to take yours to the next level this year? Ways your team is pushing to make your next annual report really sing for donors? (Not literally, but hey, that might be cool, too!) Share your thoughts in the comments…</p>

What better way to do this than with your word choices? Let’s avoid some of that overused jargon we so often see in the nonprofit world.</p>
<p>Here are a few terms we’ve seen over the past year that should be called out and questioned whenever possible:</p>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong></p>
<p>I actually can’t believe this hasn’t made our list before (especially egregious in verb form). We hear it and (confession time!) use it all the time. And it’s not nearly as clear as we think it is. I just looked it up in a dictionary, and under the definition option for “improve or enhance” (the final in a long list of meanings, I might add), an example sentence says, “It makes more sense to be able to leverage what we do in a more effective way.” What?? So if you’re <i>leveraging</i> a relationship or a partnership for a particular reason, maybe you’re taking advantage of it instead. Spell out what you mean by <i>leverage</i>, so that people understand you.</p>
<p><strong>Deep dive</strong></p>
<p>This one is more dangerous in its various implications than in its actual use. If you’re doing a <i>deep dive</i> on something, it implies that you don’t usually go deep, which might undervalue your everyday work that might actually be incredibly valuable, even if you’re “in the shallows.” One other thing to keep in mind about a <i>deep dive</i>: you’re swimming pretty close to drowning, being underwater, lost at sea, swamped…</p>
<p><strong>Utilize</strong></p>
<p>Please allow me to quote the late, great David Foster Wallace from the <i>Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus</i> (a very fine tool): “This is a puff-word. Since it does nothing that good old <i>use</i> doesn’t do, its extra letters and syllables don’t make a writer seem smarter. Rather, using <i>utilize</i> makes you seem like either a pompous twit or someone so insecure that he’ll use pointlessly big words in an attempt to look smart… ‘Formal writing’ does not mean gratuitously fancy writing; it means clean, clear, maximally considerate writing.” David Foster Wallace puts it a bit harshly, perhaps, but he knows how to make a point. Side note: my new favorite phrase is “maximally considerate writing.”</p>
<p><strong>Touchpoint</strong></p>
<p>This is another word the Ducks are guilty of using. More and more, when people want to touch base or connect during one of our processes, they suggest a <i>touchpoint</i>. How about we just have a call or a conversation or a meeting? And watch how you use <i>touch base</i> or <i>connect</i>. Is that really the clearest way to say it?</p>
<p><strong>Full potential</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a tricky one. We see this phrase a lot in the human services world, and especially once you get into the nuts and bolts of the work, it’s easy to see why. It’s fair to say that we all want children to reach their <i>full potential</i>. <i>Full potential</i> is an uncontroversial, blame-free, and general phrase that can apply to a lot of people and situations. Which is precisely its danger. It can be very vague. If you use this one—especially outside of human services—you’ll want to really explain it. And chances are pretty good that you’ve got some better options at your disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Acronyms</strong></p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the Ducks are anti-acronym. Yes, there are exceptions, and we’re not so inflexible that we can’t see them. But holy alphabet soup! The acronyms in the nonprofit world have hit some sort of all-time high. Names of organizations, programs, partnerships, departments, clients, and more, all boiled down to a few letters. Maybe it’s good shorthand if you’re speaking to someone within your organization.</p>
<p>As I write this, I’m within view of a whiteboard covered by our clients’ names as acronyms, and it’s useful. But if I go home and start praising the work of one of our nonprofit clients, and I’m referring to them by acronym, my wife will have no idea what organization I’m talking about. So please watch how you use acronyms, especially if you’re talking to someone who doesn’t work right next to you.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>This is the only word that’s appeared on this list on multiple occasions, and I had thought I was finished with it. But in my stages of grief around the use of <i>impact</i>, I seem to be moving backwards. The use of <i>impact</i> has become so ubiquitous, so overwhelming, that I’m now moving from acceptance back to bargaining. Can we at least agree to stop using <i>impact</i> as a verb? Go ahead and have an impact on the people you serve. But let’s not impact those people. Please? Hello? Is this thing on?</p>
<p><strong>But what about [insert word here]?</strong></p>
<p>This is our sixth annual edition, and we’ve covered a lot of words since 2010. So…</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re an <i>outcome-oriented</i> manager who runs <i>performance-based</i> programs at a <i>process-driven</i> nonprofit, <a href=""/big-duck-blog-language-your-nonprofit-should-not-use"" target=""_blank"">check out the 2014 list</a>.</li>
<li>If you spent most of the past year trying to <i>optimize</i> your internal <i>ecosystem</i>, <a href=""/words_to_avoid_2013_edition"" target=""_blank"">be sure to read the 2013 list</a>.</li>
<li>If you think you <i>resonate</i> with something, <a href=""/words_to_avoid_2012_edition"" target=""_blank"">you might want to read the 2012 list</a>.</li>
<li>If you’ve struggled with your <i>bandwidth</i> this year, <a href=""/words-avoid-2011-edition"" target=""_blank"">maybe take a gander at the 2011 list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The usual disclaimer:</h3>
<p>There’s always a part of me that recoils at saying you can’t or shouldn’t use certain words. The rules of language are always changing and shifting. If they didn’t, maybe I’d have considered <i>forsooth</i> for this year’s edition! So rather than thinking of this list as a form of absolutism, use it more as a guide to ask yourself: Is there a way I can say this better? If you really can’t, by all means, use the words. Maybe even <i>impact</i> as a verb. Although I seriously doubt doing so would be your best effort.</p>

<p class=""Body"">Stories&nbsp;have the power to spark movements, raise armies of volunteers, and even change the world. But stories with impact don't just happen—they require intention and heart. Good stories do more than connect our brains to dense prose and columns of statistics. Good stories connect our hearts with a heroic goal and set our minds on the path to get there.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Our greatest source of these stories of hope and change is our social sector—the nonprofits, social enterprises, and others serving the world's poor or vulnerable. Despite their extraordinary work, though, our inboxes remain flooded with PDF reports, program statistics, and verbose appeals for support.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Where are the impact stories? Why should I read your email when there are so many others demanding my attention? When so much good is being done, why are for-purpose organizations so bad at sharing their stories?&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Body"">Last year, The Rockefeller Foundation initiated a project to illuminate and elevate the practice of storytelling among the world's do-gooders. Building on the landscape report, ""<a href=""http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/digital-storytelling-social-impact"">Digital Storytelling for Social Impact</a>"", and with contributions from dozens of partners and lead grantee, Hattaway Communications, The Rockefeller Foundation launched <a href=""https://www.hatchforgood.org/"">an innovative tool to help the social sector share better, more impactful stories: Hatch</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s all this got to do with you, my lovely friends and nonprofiteers? Well, the fine folks at <a href=""https://www.warbyparker.com/annual-report-2014"">Warby Parker recently created an annual report</a> that is worth your viewing. Offering fans a “DIY style report,” the company invited customers to customize the annual report experience by answering a few short questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HyDsn_AHCj7SIDpECHbxqEP0l1R7EAY8UsRRIbEWmfdjOYGHvVj6nCSf42JnITtBIosYbSeP5BcAGU_6_4WYcY_NVALsccjOSjMkmpkIV2hqZeMCXg2KVwFgHO2dXlJfqnQ"" width=""278px;"" height=""344px;"" alt=""unnamed.jpg"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" /></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.warbyparker.com/annual-report-2014?d=bj1mYXJyYSZhPUJBQkNDQkJI"">result with my version of their annual report</a> was edu-taining… fun, informative, and all about me. They provided me with silly insight into my past year, and ideas for the year ahead with suggestions of my spirit animal (hedgehog!), books I might enjoy, and even variations on my favorite color (though I may stick with “purple rain”). One of my favorite parts was my projected nicknames for 2015, including Farra™, Five and Dime, Firth of Forth, Fresh Squeezed, and Farmer’s Friend. I’m not sure any of those will stick, but I appreciate the ideas.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like all good things online these days, there was a link to share the report with my followers via various social media channels. Well, imagine my delight when I tweeted the link and got a personalized response from the people behind the <a href=""https://twitter.com/warbyparker"" target=""_blank"">@WarbyParker account</a>. Not only did they monitor mentions of the report, they replied with a note that showed they took the extra minute to review my report and keep the exchange feeling customized.

<p dir=""ltr"">I had a blast making my report and found myself thinking how awesome it would be if nonprofits followed suit. Yes, your annual accomplishments are important to share--necessary for funding and credibility in this age of transparency and results--but where is the donor in the story of your success? Can you tie your donor’s investment into a celebration of what you’ve done together? I did delight in this <a href=""http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=800697e6337a4f98a8af2404a&amp;id=2e4691cf4a&amp;e=02e431b068"">email message from The Bowery Mission</a> which promoted their results as my results as a supporter. I hope to see more examples of these communications to engage donors and connect them to your mission in 2015. In the meantime, I’m off to try some new glasses...</p>

Fifty-one percent of the respondents in Big Duck and FDR Group’s online survey, whose data informed the <a href=""http://Rebrand%20Effect%20e-book""><em>Rebrand Effect</em> ebook</a>, noted that a new focus of their work and/or a new strategic plan was a significant catalyst for rebranding. Not only that, but organizations that have completed some sort of organizational development process also see better results than organizations that rebrand without one.</p>
<p>Here is a three-year rebranding process. You can certainly do it faster if your resources permit.</p>
<p><strong>Year One: Are Your Vision and Mission Still Clear?</strong></p>
<p>If it has been a while since your last strategic-planning session, start now. (Many organizations regularly undertake some form of strategic planning every three to five years.) Focus on getting your board and staff aligned around your work. This process often involves hearing from leadership as well as the donors, volunteers, clients, and others who make up the external fabric of your organization, through formal or informal research.</p>
<p><strong>Year Two: How Do Your Current Communications Stack Up?</strong></p>
<p>Consider field testing your existing communications to assess their effectiveness. What’s your reputation like in the field? What do donors or clients understand about you based on your website or other materials they receive? What’s the buzz about you in their circles?</p>
<p>If what you hear reflects your vision and mission well, there’s no reason to make changes. But, if you’re not happy about what you are hearing, start by setting a new communications strategy and realigning the necessary elements to reflect it. Year two should also include updating or overhauling your website and other online properties, since that’s where most people will interact with you. Train your staff and board on the new brand, and consider integrating it into your human resources practices so that staff are consistently trained and coached to be effective brand ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>Year Three: Are You Communicating with One Voice? </strong></p>
<p>By year three, make sure you’re developing campaigns and stand-alone materials that are on message and on brand, so that everything you produce looks and feels consistent, regardless of who’s producing it. Is your social media on brand? How about that speech your executive director is about to give? Your e-news? Are you communicating with one voice throughout the organization? In other words, would an outsider experience the various ways you communicate as reflecting one (your) organization’s vision and mission? If not, consider appointing someone on your team to review and coach others to help ensure consistency. Twice a year, review you’re your communications informally (on screen or via printouts) to see how you are doing.</p>
<p>No matter how long the steps in this process take, remember that doing them right should always trump doing them fast. Significant changes to your visual identity and messaging that help shape your internal culture and your external reputation should have a long shelf life, after all.</p>

They’ve raised money more successfully, increased participation in key programs, even recruited better board members. You could argue that I’m probably one of the biggest believers in the benefits of rebranding for nonprofits.</p>
<p>Despite my belief that this stuff truly works, I don’t think it’s always the right thing to do. Some organizations put the cart before the horse when they attempt a rebrand, and the results are less effective.&nbsp; Instead of trying to make it work, I’d rather see more organizations do it right, even if that means putting up with sub-par communications a bit longer.</p>
<p>This isn’t just my opinion: I’ve got data to back it up.</p>
<p>Big Duck’s 2014 ebook&nbsp;<em><a href=""/rebrandeffect"">The Rebrand Effect</a>&nbsp;</em>highlights findings from a survey of organizations that rebranded in the past 10 years. The results show that certain variables, like having the right leaders “on the bus”, or a recent strategic planning process, can significantly impact the results you’ll get when rebranding.</p>

W</span>hat stories were nonprofits telling? What language were they using? What clever new tactics were they trying?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Last year, one move stood out to me above all: the matching gift. While matching gifts have been used by fundraisers for a while, it appeared that more nonprofits than ever before were making them a part of their year-end fundraising efforts. A good portion of the direct mail pieces and emails that I opened in this past year-end cycle urged donors, “Give now and your gift will be doubled!” and promised them, “Your donation will be matched dollar for dollar if you give by December 31st!” Here at Big Duck, the majority of our campaigns clients used matching gifts to incentivize giving—from social service agencies to healthcare organizations to advocacy groups.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you’re not familiar with what matching gifts are, here’s the quick story. Put simply, a matching gift is a fundraising tactic. It’s a conditional commitment by a donor, either by an individual or an institutional funder like a corporation or a foundation, to match the contributions of others at a specific rate.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While matching gift programs were long used by companies to spur employee charitable giving (most major corporations have a matching gift program), now nonprofits are leveraging them to drive individual donor fundraising as well.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here are a few common types of matching gifts and how they work.</span></p>
<p><strong>The 1:1 match.</strong> A donors says she’ll match every gift raised, dollar for dollar, usually up to a certain amount or by a certain date. Say the matching donor gives up to $100,000 to your nonprofit by December 31st. If a gift is made for $100 before that date, the organization receives $200. Some donors will even commit to doing a 1:3 or 1:4 match. Heck, one of Big Duck’s clients this year did <em>two</em> time-bound 1:1 matches—a smaller one exclusively for Giving Tuesday and a larger one for their entire year-end efforts.</p>
<p><strong>The all or nothing matching gift.</strong> This one’s a bit intense. An individual or institutional donor commits to making a certain size gift to an organization, if and only if the same amount of money is raised by the organization in a designated time period. If the organization isn’t successful in raising the money, then they don’t receive the match. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘“take-action” match.</strong> Some organizations will secure a matching donor to give every time a supporter takes a certain action, like taking a pledge, liking their Facebook page, or signing up for their email list. This year, one of our clients had a matching donor giving $1 every time a supporter tweeted a hashtag associated with an awareness raising campaign. It’s a win-win: grow your email list and fundraise at the same time!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So, what’s the magic behind the matching gift and why all the hype?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The numbers show that matching gifts really can encourage charitable giving. Nonprofits find that offering a match increases both the average gift and the response rate of a fundraising campaign. So why might that be?</span></p>
<p><strong>They’re a deal.</strong> Everyone is looking to get more bang from their buck, even donors. So when you present a potential supporter with an opportunity to have their gift doubled or tripled, you make them feel like the impact of their gift is increased and it’s a worthwhile investment. How can someone that cares about your mission pass that up?</p>
<p><strong>They’re motivating.</strong> Matching gifts are goal-oriented. When you tell your donors that you’re trying to raise a certain amount of money and the match will help you get there, it influences them to take action and join the effort.</p>
<p><strong>They’re urgent.</strong> A matching gift is a time-sensitive invitation to take action. They say to your donors that if you don’t give now, you might miss the special opportunity to have your gift doubled. And that’d be a shame!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You might be thinking, this all sounds fabulous but what’s the bad news? I think there are a couple things that you should be mindful of. &nbsp;First, it seems that the prevalence of matching gifts in the nonprofit world has been on the rise. While I think it’s too early to tell, it’s possible that the motivating effect they have on donors might eventually wear off with time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Secondly, before you reach for the phone to secure a matching donor, be sure to consider if it’s the right fit for your organization’s donors. After all, not every donor is created equal, and as a fundraiser, you know your donors best. Be sure you consider whether your existing or prospective supporters might be inspired to give because of a match. If you’re not sure, you may want to test it first, through a smaller campaign, before you roll it out in a big way around year-end.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If your organization hasn’t leveraged a matching gift to drive fundraising yet, I’d say consider it in your 2015 fundraising plans. It has been a tried-and-true tactic in the fundraising toolkit for good reason: it seems to work.</span>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","Matching gifts drives year-end fundraising","","","nonprofits leverage matching gifts in 2014 fundraising","fundraising campaigns yearend donors","fundraising campaigns yearend donors","",

It seems so easy—it’s just a name, after all—but finding the perfect name is more elusive than a yeti sighting. Why is that?</p>","<p class=""MemoHeaderCxSpFirst"">Naming or renaming your organization (or even a major program) can be one of the hardest things you can go through in the branding process. It seems so easy—it’s just a name, after all—but finding the perfect name is more elusive than a yeti sighting. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>First of all, there’s no such thing as a “perfect name.”</strong> If you’ve lived with your current name for one, five, 20, or even 100 years or more, anything else will feel weird. Imagine that your name is Betty, and people suddenly start calling you Gordon. This is exactly the leap you’ll need to make if you’re changing your name. If you’re a new, unnamed organization, it’s likely that any name will feel somewhat limiting. Accept the limitation, and you may find it opens you up to opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>A name just has to get the job done.&nbsp;</strong>We put a lot of pressure on names, but there’s only one thing your name absolutely must do: identify you. It should do so without being misleading or confusing, and it should be easy to remember. But it’s actually quite a prosaic thing with a specific function. It’s more important that you find something legally available you can all agree on than it is to go on the search for the Holy Grail of names.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise is at the heart of naming.&nbsp;</strong>When building consensus, you’ll soon find that one person’s “great name!” is the next person’s “worst name ever!” The only way you’ll be successful is if everyone in the room is open to possibility and willing to explore the potential in any of the name options in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>You will not “know it when you hear it.”&nbsp;</strong>In fact, if you think you’ve “heard the one,” you may be wrong. The truth is, you shouldn’t just know your name when you hear it once. You need to examine it and ultimately search it thoroughly to make sure there are no other organizations like yours that use it or something like it.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone has an opinion.&nbsp;</strong>But not everyone has considered fully the strategy behind your name. And yet, especially before you’ve officially decided on something, people will share their opinions freely. There’s a reason parents don’t share baby names before the child is born. Once the child is born, his or her name is simply a fact. You’re striving to make your name a fact. Keep your committee as tight as possible and make sure they know what your overall brand strategy is.</p>
<p><strong>You need to do your homework.&nbsp;</strong>This doesn’t just mean asking people what they think; it means getting intellectual property lawyers involved. They need to do a thorough search to see if the name (or something deemed too similar) is already registered, especially if it’s already in your area of work. Yes, you should Google your potential name and do some searching around URLs, but you can’t stop there. Your name needs to last.</p>
<p><strong>You have a couple of names on the table. What do you do next?&nbsp;</strong>First of all, pat yourself on the back for getting this far. It’s a new name and that’s exciting! Then live with your name options a little. One of the things we recommend to clients is that they actually spend a day or two “trying it on.” Refer to yourself as one of your potential new names throughout the day with your colleagues. See how it feels, see how it sounds, see how people get used to it. After a day or two, try on the next name. Then discuss your experiences as a group.</p>

<p>I’m so eager to share with you the incredible learning experience I had at the recent&nbsp;Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC) . I learned all about nonprofit rebranding via&nbsp;Farra Trompeter, Vice President of&nbsp;<a href=""http://bigducknyc.com/"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck</a>, and Will Nolan, Senior Vice President of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD)</a>.&nbsp;Here are a few key takeaways to help you&nbsp;understand the potential of brand for our causes, and knowing when it’s time for a change.</p>
<p><strong>First Things First: What’s a Brand?<br /></strong>Your nonprofit’s brand represents your identity, your promise to donors and constituents, and the consistency of your work. The principles outlined here are relevant whether you’re shaping a first-time (intentional) brand for your organization, or you’re rebranding.</p>
<p>Whether we’re talking&nbsp;Red Cross or Coca-Cola, brands that work connect with our hearts<em>and</em>&nbsp;minds to trigger emotion&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;action. The difference, Farra says, is that with companies, we have a transactional relationship;&nbsp;with nonprofits, we have a transformational relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Brand Positioning vs. Organizational Personality<br /></strong>These two terms are tossed around a lot, but what do they really mean?&nbsp;If positioning is the big idea, personality is the feeling in your people’s&nbsp;hearts, says Farra.</p>
<p>Effective&nbsp; positioning ensures that a big idea is&nbsp;<em>consistently</em>&nbsp;associated with the brandÚ For what expertise&nbsp;or service are you the go-to? Your personality should answer the question: What do you want them to feel?</p>
<p>Zero in on what your organization is trying to do or be before jumping to positioning &amp; personality. Get clear on who you are—and who you’re trying to reach. It’s the only way to get relevant. Beware, there is no such thing as “the general public.”&nbsp;If you try to reach everyone, you’ll fail, and you’re likely to alienate the folks you really want to engage.</p>
<p><strong>Why Are SO Many Orgs (Re)branding?<br /></strong>Rebranding helps orgs&nbsp;erase outdated&nbsp;geographical boundaries, market smarter, and better reflect their work. A rebrand bridges from the before to what’s new when orgs shift focus or restructure.</p>
<p>Your nonprofit’s brand is a&nbsp;powerful way to synchronize your efforts across programs and channels. Clear branding, guidelines, and communications tools actually make it easier for everyone to speak on your behalf.&nbsp;This is particularly important for organizations that have many staff, as well as external supporters, acting as spokespeople.</p>
<p>Shoring up your brand can also help you recruit better board members and staff, improve your internal capacity, and attract more media coverage. Your people ARE your brand!</p>
<p><strong>But Your (Re)brand Does Even MORE<br /></strong>Done well, rebranding (OR first-time branding) enables your org to more clearly define and share your niche, which makes it easier for your people to connect with you, and ultimately increase revenue through</p>
<p>Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy’s rebrand helped the org&nbsp;become more direct and consistent in their communications. They shifted their tagline from “Leading the Duchenne muscular dystrophy community” to a bolder statement: “Leading the fight to end Duchenne.” Their new colors, logo, and positioning now reflect this strong vision.</p>
<p>This change allowed them to reframe their communications around a clear mission. As a result, PPMD increased community participation&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;its email list size.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, We Want to (Re)brand! Now What?<br /></strong>First, understand that your brand—whether the first brand or a (re)brand—is a sum of many individual parts,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;just a name or logo.</p>
<p>When it comes to (re)branding, updating your organization’s brand identity often has the most impact. Identity includes the visual elements of your brand (such as logos, colors, imagery) and your key messaging (tagline, boilerplate).</p>
<p><strong>When Should We (Re)Brand&nbsp;?<br /></strong>Good branding helps your cause break through the noise. This is important for many organizations, as the environment in which they’re operating can change over time. If your organization has changed its focus, or the environment has shifted, consider updating your brand.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>When&nbsp;Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy kicked off its rebranding process, staff thought hard about the&nbsp;&nbsp;the equity in the existing name. Keep in mind that brands can be fluid (although you wouldn’t want to rebrand more than every five or ten years, and that’s even a lot). Over time, your organization’s essence may not change, but elements of your brand or structure may need to.</p>
<p>Is it time for your nonprofit to rebrand? Big Duck’s&nbsp;<a href=""/timetorebrand"" target=""_blank"">brand flowchart</a>&nbsp;will help you decide.</p>
<p><strong>What Do High-Impact Nonprofit (Re)Brands Have In Common?<br /></strong>These are some of the factors likely to lead to (re)branding success can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;clear, focused, understood-and-acted-on&nbsp;<em>throughout the organization</em>&nbsp;strategic plan (a must!)</li>
<li>New leadership</li>
<li>New fundraising strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, if your organization is currently going through a strategic planning process, complete that process before (re)branding. You’ll have better alignment, as your organization’s vision will be clearer.</p>

Or even staff people who have, as part of their job description, some responsibilities for creating or managing external communications?</p>
<p>Unlike for-profit businesses of comparable size, nonprofits don't typically hire people in communications jobs until the organization reaches a certain size: often somewhere around a $4 million operating budget or a staff well into the double digits.</p>
<p>In bigger organizations, communications people sometimes work in the development department (often reporting up to a ""Director of Advancement"" who's typically a fundraiser). Maybe several staff people take on various communications responsibilities within various departments. With little or no coordination between them, this can often result in duplicated efforts, conflicting messages, or other ""silo issues.""</p>
<p>At the end of a workshop I gave for the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network in San Francisco in 2010, a participant asked me what she thinks is the optimal staffing structure for communications. In particular, should development people should have oversight for communications, or communications over development?</p>
<p>I’ve been stewing on this question for years and can't say there's one ""right"" way to do it. As with most things, it depends... on the vision, mission, and objectives of the organization, on the types of audiences they are aiming to reach, and other variables. (Hey, if the answers were easy we'd all have them, right?)</p>
<p>Questions around communications staffing have gotten even more complex in the past two years as it's become increasingly difficult for nonprofits to avoid participating in social media. Communications of all types increasingly require ongoing feeding and watering to be sustained, so somebody (hopefully somebody responsive and mission-minded) needs to have a job description that includes it.</p>
<p>After years of observing how nonprofits manage communications, for better and for worse, we Ducks aren't convinced that staffing structure is the real challenge. Instead, we think the more important question is&nbsp;<i>what type of culture does your organization have around communication?</i></p>
<p>In a nonprofit that truly values good communications, you'll find:</p>
<p><b>A mature, transparent culture around sharing information internally and externally.</b></p>
<p>People know what their colleagues are working on and <a href=""/big-duck-blog-creating-audience-centric-experiences-across-channels"" target=""_blank"">are clear about how their work relates, supports, and connects.</a> In meetings, they offer updates about their work and leave thinking about what information should be shared internally and externally. They take the initiative to share rather than waiting to be told, and are trusted by leadership to share appropriately (rather than having to seek approval for everything they send out). A transparent exchange of information is encouraged, and people generally view their colleagues in other departments as allies.</p>
<p><b>A defined budget for communications.</b></p>
<p>Instead of scrimping together a few shekels to update the website on the down low, <a href=""/nonprofit-budget-planning-for-the-new-fiscal-year"" target=""_blank"">organizations that value communications budget for it</a>. They have line items in every budget for staffing, printing, and other external communications support they might need (e.g. consultants, developers, etc).</p>
<p>It's also important to anticipate years that will require additional communications mojo (a major website overhaul, for example, or a new identity process) and budget for it proactively- perhaps seeking specific funds for the project.</p>
<p>If your nonprofit isn't there yet, I'd suggest beginning a conversation about communications with the folks who manage the budget by looking at how your peers do it and considering an appropriate percentage of your annual operating budget (perhaps 5%). Remember that effective online, printed, and other communications increase your visibility and reputation and reinforce your credibility, which helps your donors, programs audiences, and advocates feel better about connecting with and supporting you. It's a growth strategy- not navel-gazing.</p>
<p><b>Real, live human beings who are responsible for communications.</b></p>
<p>Most nonprofits now realize they can't afford to ignore social media, but few have staffed for it. Bigger national and international organizations like the Red Cross or the Humane Society of the United States not only have communications staff people, they even have (several) folks devoted exclusively to social media. If your budget is too small for a dedicated communications person on staff, at least try to build communications tasks and responsibilities into other job descriptions (maybe your fundraiser can handle it?).</p>
<p><b>A long view attitude.</b></p>
<p>Instead of diving in to social media reactively or producing all sorts of materials with dubious ROI (return on investment), organizations with a healthy communications culture bite off what they can chew and focus on doing that well- not on doing everything. They keep an eye out for the latest trends, technologies, and tools that might affect their work, monitor how others in their area are communicating, and make refinements for the long haul, instead of working reactively. The ""long view"" is a concept outlined in detail in&nbsp;<a href=""/how/book"" target=""_blank""><i>Brandraising</i></a>. It's about maintaining a look at the bigger picture, and not just working in the trenches constantly.</p>

<p>""I am not saying ignore what’s working for large organizations,” writes ActionSprout CEO Drew Bernard, “they often provide great inspiration. But don’t mistake what they are doing as a path to success.”</p>
<p>His email came in response to a call for help I sent out to a brain trust of progressive digital advocacy wonks. After watching countless small nonprofits struggle to establish digital presences, I was losing faith that organizations with at most a handful of communications staff working across all media could compete.</p>
<p>Nonprofits that have been pioneers in this space like&nbsp;<a title=""MoveOn"" href=""http://moveon.org/"" target=""_blank"">MoveOn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=""Avaaz"" href=""http://avaaz.org/"" target=""_blank"">Avaaz</a>&nbsp;have brought new sophistication to progressive digital organizing, leveraging big data, integrating engagement across platforms, and tailoring communications and content to specific audiences. But how does a nonprofit with a couple thousand Facebook likes and an Excel spreadsheet of donors make use of this?</p>
<p>Well, as Bernard contends, they don’t. At the end of the day, if small nonprofits are going to use digital tools successfully, they need their own model that builds on strategies that already make them successful and leverages strengths that aren’t available to larger groups.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
<blockquote style=""padding-left: 30px;"" class=""pull-quote"">""I hear the same advice at practically every digital strategy conference and event I attend – test everything.

<p>The&nbsp;<a title=""2015 Digital Outlook Report"" href=""http://www.nten.org/blog/2015/02/11/announcing-the-2015-digital-outlook-report"" target=""_blank"">2015 Digital Outlook Report</a>&nbsp;on nonprofits trends and strategy by&nbsp;<a title=""Care2"" href=""http://care2.com/"" target=""_blank"">Care2</a>,&nbsp;<a title=""hjc new media"" href=""http://hjcnewmedia.com/"" target=""_blank"">hjc</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=""NTEN.org"" href=""http://nten.org/"" target=""_blank"">NTEN</a>&nbsp;found that most of the organizations they surveyed did not have any staff devoted to digital. That leaves an organization’s online presence in the hands of a many-hatted staffer who is also juggling communication, development and other responsibilities. Time and resource constraints are obvious concerns when a staff member must cover half a dozen major social media networks, email, web, and all the CRMs, CMS’s, email marketing and project management tools that have become best practice. But there’s more to it than that.</p>
<p>For one, many strategies require scale to have an impact. “Split testing emails, landing pages and closely monitoring and adapting ads all pay off,” writes Eugene Flynn of&nbsp;<a title=""54 degrees"" href=""http://www.54degrees.com/"" target=""_blank"">54 degrees</a>, “but mostly when you’re dealing with large numbers. A 1% increase in click-through conversions can mean a lot for an organisation like Greenpeace, but if you’re dealing with a small list of supporters those increases may mean very little.”</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mobilisationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email_marketing_800.png"" rel=""lightbox[7499]"" title=""It's all just organizing"" class=""cboxElement""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7512"" src=""http://www.mobilisationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email_marketing_800.png"" alt=""Email marketing optimization"" width=""480"" height=""480"" /></a></p>
<p>At the same time, the rapid pace of technological change can create a near constant need to catch up with current trends. I recently received an email from the social media listening service&nbsp;<a title=""Attentive.ly"" href=""http://attentive.ly/"" target=""_blank"">Attentive.ly</a>&nbsp;offering advice on how to “Create the Perfect Facebook Ad from Realtime Social Listening.” Inside, the email read:</p>
<p class=""alt"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Download the Guide before Facebook changes their algorithm!</strong></p>
<p>I recognize the company’s interest in creating a sense of urgency, but the underlying message—that the shelf life of tactics in the social media space is extremely short—is another barrier to adoption.</p>
<p>And it’s not just vendors creating this pressure. Boards, senior leadership staff and other stakeholders contribute to the race for current-ness. Sarah Alexander of&nbsp;<a title=""Food and Water Watch"" href=""http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/"" target=""_blank"">Food and Water Watch</a>, who terms this “The Shiny Object Pitfall” admits that it is a challenge even in her digitally-savvy organization.</p>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">""Our&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/foodandwater/"">Pinterest</a>&nbsp;board is an example. A few years ago a lot of staff, including me, were personally excited about it as a tool to get people involved in making social change. But Pinterest is mostly about people posting recipes and home décor ideas, so it’s not really where our supporters are likely to engage with us. We’re still using it, but we’ve changed our expectations and are focusing more on other channels.""</blockquote>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">
<p class=""pull-quote-by-line"">– Sarah Alexander, Food and Water Watch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, plenty of donors and board members&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;post recipes and home décor ideas to Pinterest. Alexander points out that, living in a digital age, it’s easy to believe that we intuitively know what works.</p>
<p>However, all of our instincts are influenced by our unique backgrounds and biases. “Even when you have savvy NGOs, ” writes digital strategy consultant Jed Miller, “you can have a donor who says ‘We don’t care about that, we just want to see more views on a slick, but inert, advocacy video that will play better at Davos than anywhere else in the world.’ Donors are often looking for something that fits their own culture of reporting, annual metrics, and what can easily be plugged into an Excel spreadsheet.”</p>
<p>Put these pressures together, and it creates a very bad recipe. Communications staff are constantly playing catch-up with a rapidly changing digital landscape while a variety of internal and external stakeholders encourage them to reach for the latest, shiniest tactic or technology, and many of the organizations they can look to for guidance are working at scale that makes their models inapplicable.</p>
<p>Add to that the scarcity mentality of very limited resources and staff time and what do they do? Far too often, says Miller, they simply plow ahead.</p>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">
<blockquote>""NGOs and community based organisations&nbsp;are often founded by activists—and activists already have an ‘enough talk, let’s get out there, let’s get to the press and get stuff up on the web’ attitude. That’s the way they think, but they don’t need to.""</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class=""pull-quote-by-line"">-Jed Miller</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The results of this sort of plowing ahead are not pretty. Even as email volume has skyrocketed and powerful email marketing, fundraising and constituent relationship management tools have proliferated, a&nbsp;<a title=""Online fundraising study by Dunham &amp; Company and Next After"" href=""http://www.dunhamandcompany.com/2014/01/nonprofits-receive-poor-grades-in-study-of-online-fundraising-dunhamcompany-study-finds/"" target=""_blank"">2014 study</a>by&nbsp;<a title=""Dunham and Company"" href=""http://www.dunhamandcompany.com/"" target=""_blank"">Dunham+Company</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=""Next After"" href=""http://nextafter.com/"" target=""_blank"">Next After</a>&nbsp;found that 88% of nonprofits still had not developed a welcome series of emails for new subscribers. The effort is there and the tools are there, but they are not producing the results they could.</p>
<p>It may be, however, that that precise insight—<strong>that activists continue to think like activists when they go online</strong>—could help organizations use digital tools more effectively.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Sarah Alexander’s background was in field organizing, and she remembers the trepidation she felt taking over the fledgling digital program at Food &amp; Water Watch:</p>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">“At the time I was like, ‘I don’t know anything about this, what am I gonna do?’ A good friend from MoveOn said, ‘Sarah, you know how to organize, it’s all just organizing.’ From there I built out a set of best practices.”</blockquote>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">
<p class=""pull-quote-by-line"">– Sarah Alexander, Food and Water Watch</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://www.mobilisationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/its_all_organizing_800.png"" rel=""lightbox[7499]"" title=""It's all just organizing"" class=""cboxElement""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-7513"" src=""http://www.mobilisationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/its_all_organizing_800-300x300.png"" alt=""It's all just organizing"" width=""300"" height=""300"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" /></a></p>
<p>For Alexander, everything stems from the ultimate goal of moving constituents up the ladder of engagement and getting them to take action, often in-person, on behalf of the organization’s campaigns. This may all seem common sense, but the critical insight is that successful small organizations, regardless of their performance in the digital sphere, excel in the provision of their core offering.&nbsp;If digital organizing is just an extension of in-person organizing, then small organizations should be able to leverage the same strengths that make them successful in both worlds.</p>
<p>“I think the key to this is figuring out and acknowledging the strengths a smaller organisation has over a bigger one and turning your size into an advantage rather than a perceived disadvantage,” says Eugene Flynn. Given this challenge, I set out to ask some of the sharpest people I know what that might look like.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><strong>Leveraging the Strengths of Small Organizations</strong></h3>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">""I often have to stop myself when I realize I’m just assuming that a cutting-edge digital strategy is the right move. If you have 1,000 people on the list, deploying A/B testing perhaps isn’t as useful as, say, calling every single one of them and having an actual conversation. So the conversation could shift from 'let’s scale this back' to 'what is already working, what are we great at, what is our strength – and how do we double-down on that.'""</blockquote>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">
<p class=""pull-quote-by-line"">– Jesse Littlewood, Echo &amp; Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Nimble-ness</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that arose as a strength of successful small nonprofits is not something typically ascribed to the sector: nimbleness. “The greatest asset smaller organizations have,” says Drew Bernard, “is their ability to move quickly, try things, double down when things are working well and move on quickly when they don’t.”</p>
<p>For organizations used to operating with a scarcity mentality, the idea of trial and error can be a scary one, but the importance of experimentation and risking failure has almost become a truism in the field. “Failure is not a final step,” says Jed Miller. “Failure is feedback.” And if organizations like Greenpeace are the Apples of the nonprofit world, then small organizations have the opportunity to look more like startups.</p>
<p>This can be a huge asset, says Michael Silberman of the&nbsp;<a title=""Mobilisation Lab"" href=""http://mobilisationlab.org/"">Mobilisation Lab at Greenpeace</a>. “Organizations with tighter budgets and smaller staffs have an even greater incentive and ability to adopt a startup mentality and practice&nbsp;<a title=""Be a Lean NGO: Overcoming three key hurdles to build a more iterative organization"" href=""http://www.mobilisationlab.org/be-a-lean-ngo-overcoming-three-key-hurdles-to-build-a-more-iterative-organization/"" target=""_blank"">integrating Lean principles</a>&nbsp;into their work,“ he says, referring to the popular startup business methodology—“even more so than well funded organizations who need to get many more people on the same page.”</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title=""Lean Startup principles"" href=""http://theleanstartup.com/principles"" target=""_blank"">Lean model</a>, like others that emphasize failing fast, doesn’t propound risk-taking as an end unto itself, but as a way to shorten the feedback loop between organizational strategy and measurable results. For organizations without large financial cushions, it is imperative to course-correct before losing a year of fundraising or enduring the impact of a flawed strategy.</p>
<p>There is another kind of risk, of course, in adopting the practices of another sector wholesale. This article, after all, is premised on how large-organization digital models fit small organizations poorly. It is clear, however, that the organizations of any size that get out early in the news cycle, react quickly to the online zeitgeist, and keep their message in tune with the conversations their constituents are involved in are the ones who are winning. That requires organizational agility.</p>
<p><strong>2. Connected-ness</strong></p>
<p>Facebook advocacy tool developer ActionSprout recently released a set of “<a title=""ActionSprout social scorecards"" href=""http://actionsprout.com/scorecards/%20"" target=""_blank"">social scorecards</a>” for environmental nonprofits to try to measure how well different organizations were able to get their Facebook fans to engage with their content.</p>
<p>One critique of the ranking from a member of the progressive community was that the results might be skewed by small organizations interacting directly with their constituents and thereby boosting engagement rates. The critique was a valid because direct interaction can boost engagement rates and it’s easier to interact with 200 fans than 200,000. But in terms of the end result, it highlights a significant strength of small organizations.</p>
<p>How did an organization with only 237 fans make it into the top five? Their staff may know every one of their fans on a first-name basis; they could have just spoken to each one of them on the phone; or their digital staff could be Facebook friends with each one and be engaging in a truly bi-directional manner. Having a small number of supporters may not be an asset but smaller organizations do have the opportunity to interact personally with their constituents and deepen their engagement.</p>
<p>This engagement has significance beyond accumulating likes and shares. Eugene Flynn recently had a small client who needed to produce a video but did not have the resources for actors or a scriptwriter. By reaching out to their community, they attracted not only donations for the video but also offers from constituents to produce and act in the video pro bono. This sort of collaborative relationship can mobilize action in a way that would be impossible with a Twitter following of a million.</p>
<p><strong>3. Networked-ness</strong></p>
<p>Size can be an asset, of course. Lobbying Congress or reaching the pages of a national news source as a small organization can be challenging. However, just as technology has made collaboration with constituents easier, it is making collaboration between nonprofits more meaningful.</p>
<p>Marty Kearns of&nbsp;<a title=""Netcentric Campaigns"" href=""http://www.netcentriccampaigns.org/%20"" target=""_blank"">Netcentric Campaigns</a>&nbsp;has been working for years to develop nonprofit networks that build power for small groups, including&nbsp;<a title=""Prevent Obesity network"" href=""http://www.preventobesity.net/"" target=""_blank"">Preventobesity.net</a>,&nbsp;<a title=""Halt the Harm network"" href=""http://www.halttheharm.net/"" target=""_blank"">Halttheharm.net</a>, and&nbsp;<a title=""Moving Maryland Forward network"" href=""http://www.movingmdforward.net/"" target=""_blank"">movingmdforward.net</a>. These networks create visibility for issues and help achieve efficiencies normally reserved for larger organizations. “Our aim,” says Kearns “is to build power to solve a problem through creating working capacity among the leaders establishing stronger network ties among them AND building capacity to help their work alone.”</p>
<p>Movingmdforward.net has pooled resources from dozens of organizations working on different issues to win same-sex marriage and the repeal of the death penalty in Maryland, among other issues. Many large organizations also participate in coalitions, but nonprofits that do not have the capacity to develop custom tools and have a smaller voice, they are a particularly powerful asset.</p>
<p>Additionally, coalitions and networks can serve as laboratories for their members. “It can be helpful to look at, ‘Where else are your supporters looking to take action?’, says Farra Trompeter, Vice President of nonprofit strategy firm Big Duck. “Who else do they support? Should you join before you create your own campaign?”</p>
<p>Organizations that are willing to seek out the most effective efforts of their partners and jump on the bandwagon will be able to skip many failed, or less-successful experiments. And when coalition members do initiate their own efforts, they can inform their work with lessons learned by other organizations.</p>

<h3 class=""alt"">That’s All Great, but How Does an Organization Shift to This Model?</h3>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">Ultimately I think that the question isn’t whether bigger groups have more opportunity to experiment with digital innovation, it’s whether organizational staff and culture supports the key elements that allow for new approaches (digital or other).</blockquote>
<blockquote class=""pull-quote"">
<p class=""pull-quote-by-line"">-Jed Miller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being nimble, networked, and closely connected to constituents is easier said than done. Many organizations wish to be some or all of these things, but are unable. For some of these organizations, the idea of being a cutting edge digital player may seem completely unattainable with the other priorities they have to balance. But every strategist and digital director I spoke to cited organizational culture and structure as the primary obstacles.</p>
<p>“Change related to digital strategy is more similar than it is different from other sorts of organizational change,” says Jed Miller. “We have to get past the 21st century version of dad getting fed up before you’ve shown him how the remote control works.”</p>
<p>The first critical element to allowing organizations to evolve and experiment is empowering digital staff. “The Devil’s in the details,” says Michael Silberman. “Figuring out how a small organization can set itself up for a low-bureaucracy environment and enable a single digital mobilisation staff person to help the organization get out first and fast on an issue it’s working on, for example, could be much more valuable than running extensive email tests.” The end goal of both efforts is sending out content that resonates, but using sophisticated tools to optimise subject lines and email content has limited value if it delays communications until they’re stale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Shiny Object Pitfall can make running extensive email tests and adopting other cutting-edge strategies difficult to pass up. “The digital barrier to entry for small organizations is so much easier than it was even just five years ago,” says Leda Dederich. “You really can have a website up in 30 minutes, by a non-techy user for almost no fee. You’ve got so many free or almost free resources at your fingertips. But, this variety of communication channels and choices seems to be growing exponentially. And this presents a very different problem. Lots of opportunities, yes, but where to focus?”</p>
<p>That’s why clearly defining strategy is so critical. “It doesn’t have to be a huge production,” says Farra Trompeter. “The important part is doing something instead of doing nothing. If all you can do is squeeze in a two-hour brainstorming session, just get the people in the room who need to agree.” Without this agreement, “empowering digital staff” is more like an unsupervised game of pin the tail on the donkey.</p>
<p>Limiting approval chains and taking time out for strategic planning can be a difficult sell at some organizations, but the impact they have can make the case for why these reforms are necessary.</p>
<p>“There are some pretty simple metrics to measure impact,” says Sarah Alexander. “Once you have a plan in place and can show what impact you’re having, it’s a lot easier when somebody comes and wants do some new things to say ok, well yes, but here’s what it’s going to displace. That’s ok if that’s what we all decided, just so we’re all aware of the consequences.” Organizational leaders have to be willing to follow the evidence, but members taking action and donations coming in are pretty compelling arguments for supporting digital staff to do what’s needed.</p>

Their membership is much older—65 or 70. At the event, one of the audience members asked about doing Twitter today. Maybe the question was a plant, but it gave them the opportunity to walk through it for everybody.

<p>On the outside, Iowa CCI doesn’t stick out as a digital innovator. Their website is not flashy, and their social media presence, while active, is not chock-full of slickly-produced content. But the organization’s strategy is not about glitz. “They’re using it for organizing,” says Alexander, “There wasn’t anything fancy about what they did, but from a user experience it made me feel very positive and great and like they cared that I was there.”</p>
<p>Part of the secret, says Iowa CCI Digital Organizer Emily&nbsp;Harmon, is their lightweight approval process. “We have really clear steps for getting stuff out there. We have a small chain. No red tape, no bureaucratic mess.” And the size of the organization is a key enabler for this lean structure. “We have a small staff and open workspace. Clear communication and always staying in contact has been critical.”</p>
<p>The digital experiments that this has made possible—like the program to train older members on how to use Twitter—are focused on organizing impact. Harmon reports that the consistent, hands-on engagement has increased Twitter followers and social media engagement generally, but more importantly it has led to constituents taking action (often in real life) to support their campaigns.</p>
<p>For Iowa CCI, a small organization with a dedicated supporter base, this investment is worthwhile. “We’re all about members,” she says. “We know them well and can just pick up the phone and call someone. We do one-on-one’s with members. That’s a whole part of empowering folks to use their voices.”</p>
<p>This very personal model might not seem like it would scale well to larger stages, but Iowa CCI works on national issues like immigration and bank regulation. One way they’re able to do this is through their membership in&nbsp;<a title=""National People's Action"" href=""http://npa-us.org/"" target=""_blank"">National People’s Action</a>, a network of grassroots groups that provides capacity and partners across the country. This affiliation, says Harmon, builds power. In recent years, NPA campaigns have won new regulations for payday loans, a leadership change at the Federal Housing Finance Administration, and changes to the tax code. These efforts have been driven by dozens of organizations across the country.</p>
<p>Iowa CCI still operates under typical resource and capacity constraints—the kind that make most small nonprofits shy away from anything ambitious in the digital realm, but Harmon is pragmatic. “You have to analyze the potential risk,” she says, discussing a recent campaign to engage new users through a Facebook-based photo contest. “The biggest risk was we’d put it out there and no one would do it. We think of the biggest failure, and how to prevent that.”</p>
<p>Another group that was cited in my interviews as punching above its weight is&nbsp;<a title=""Parents Project Muscular Dystrophy"" href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=nws_index"" target=""_blank"">Parents Project Muscular Dystrophy</a>(PPMD), a twenty-person organization fighting to cure Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Like Iowa CCI, the name doesn’t scream innovation, but being nimble is in the organization’s DNA. “Our founder created PPMD out of frustration at existing organizations 20-some years ago that were stagnant and slow moving,” says PPMD Senior Vice President of Communications &amp; Administration Will Nolan. “This is a fatal disease and a disease that affects children. We don’t have time to waste, so we don’t do anything slowly. “</p>
<p>The beauty of this statement, is that these are clearly the words of an activist. Somewhere between the black box of the Facebook algorithm and the seeming randomness of varying response rates to email subject line tweaks, digital strategy can come to seem like a dark art—or at least a science along the lines of particle accelerator design. But for PPMD, the calculus is simple.</p>
<p>“They have a very small, but passionate community of parents of children who have this fatal disorder,” says Farra Trompeter, who has worked with the group for years. “They have a small team but have built up over time and they have committed to doing things that their community really cares about. They don’t use stock photos, they use their community. They just know their community so well.”</p>
<p>When annual appeal season approached this year, PPMD turned to their very immediate community, filming a video of two of their funders’ sons with a iPhone. “It was hugely successful and had no production value,” says Nolan. “It was done in two takes. You can spend a lot of money on materials, but if it doesn’t speak to the personality of your organization, it’s not going to be as successful as something that comes from an emotional place and place of heart that reflects your organization’s personality. It’s the organic stuff, it just requires you to be nimble.”</p>
<p>In discussing the organization’s success, Nolan cited the trust that allows for a short approval process and getting out in front of the news cycle. He cited the organization’s ability to draw on content, expert commentary and other contributions from the PPMD community. He also cited the organization’s coalition work and willingness to raise up the work of other organizations and individual parents who have been touched by Duchenne. But at the end of the day, it’s all just organizing.</p>
<p>“For me the limitations of money and resources should just be a challenge to be even more creative and come up with something because then you have bigger victories,” says Nolan. “I’m always inspired by peer groups who are taking these things that are seemingly negative and making something great out of them.”</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Those guys know how to put on a conference. The agenda was jam-packed with excellent speakers like </span><span><a href=""http://stevenashattuck.com/"">Steven Shattuck of Bloomerang</a>&nbsp;and</span><span>&nbsp;Kristina Halvorson of </span><a href=""http://braintraffic.com/""><span>Brain Traffic</span></a><span>, talking about a nice mix of strategy and tactics for nonprofit communicators. </span></p>
<p>Although the content of each session ranged, the overarching theme everyone touched on could arguably have been “less is more.” Experts in just about every session I attended cautioned nonprofits to bite off only what they can chew, set realistic expectations, and go deeper rather than broader.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Vu Lee of </span><a href=""http://nonprofitwithballs.com/""><span>nonprofitwithballs.com</span></a><span>, for instance, encouraged nonprofits to share candid feedback with funders about the impact of restricted funding and to stop saying that 100% of a person's donations go to programming.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span><a href=""http://www.ignitedfundraising.com/about/""><span>Lori Jacobwith from Ignited Fundraising</span></a><span>’s session was a hands-on workshop for organizations that need help telling their story. In it, she coached participants as they developed their stories in three sentences, then in just six words. Less is more, she advised: don’t try to say it all, every time. Just get the conversation started.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Lori has also developed a complete storytelling system that, like her workshops and webinars, breaks down abstract concepts into clear, simple modules that just about anyone can put into use. The exercises she did in her workshop are included in her book, along with tips to facilitate exercises in your organization. There’s even a fancy thumb drive with videos to supplement the book. </span><a href=""http://www.ignitedfundraising.com/product/storytelling-system/""><span>You can purchase it via Ignited Fundraising’s website</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So: how and when do you take the time to pause, develop the right stories to engage your donors, study the results you’re getting, and focus on getting everyone on the same page? For many people I speak with, it feels hard to slow down long enough to do that. The work itself is sophisticated, or perhaps because we’re living in such hectic, noisy times, we try to tackle it all. It was refreshing to hear so many speakers at Cause Camp 2015 reminding nonprofit communicators and fundraisers to keep things realistic and avoid Shiny Object Syndrome.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you’re trying to figure out how to shift your culture to be more deliberate and focused on results, consider spending time in May and June planning out your July-to-December calendar for donor communications or programmatic recruitment.

But while the creation of your brand is both exciting and intense, keeping it consistent and relevant over time can be just as essential to your reputation. Just like it is important to check on your own health every year, so is too is the need for a periodic brand audit or check-up.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Big Duck conducts several brand check-ups every year</span><span>—</span><span>both for organizations we’ve developed brands for and for some we have not (we would be happy to tell you all about it</span><span>—</span><a href=""/contact"" target=""_blank""><span>just drop us a line here</span></a><span>)</span><span>. If you think this is something you might want to try in-house,</span><span> here is a four-step process you can follow to check on the health of your nonprofit’s brand.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>1. Book an appointment. </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Start by carving out time to focus on this review. Begin by blocking out a morning or afternoon and commit to tuning out the usual distractions of emails, social media, calls, and other meetings. Invite a few of your colleagues from different teams or departments to participate on a brand review committee. Getting diverse perspectives, especially from those that know different members of your community (e.g. donors, volunteers, program participants, funders, activists, etc.), will help you better understand how your organization is communicating with others. Be sure to invite not just the most senior members of the team, but also the ones who interact most frequently with your community. If you have any board members that are connected to specific groups of constituents and/or have communications expertise, consider inviting them, too.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2. Take the pulse of where you are.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Now it is time to revisit your brand strategy and see if it still matches your organization's strategy and communications. Most nonprofit organizations develop strategic plans every three to five years and/or create annual work plans. Does the explanation of your organization’s purpose, vision, and activities line up with the written, spoken, and visual explanation of who you say you are? And how closely aligned are elements like your mission and values with the thoughts and feelings evoked by your logo or “about us” boilerplate copy? Use your desired positioning (the big idea you hope others might associate with your organization) and personality (the tone and feelings you hope others would use to describe you) as a barometer. If you’ve developed these tools in a recent branding process, use them to review recent publications, your website, your appeals, etc. If you have not developed a brand strategy yet, facilitate exercises with your brand review committee to hone in on what you hope your reputation could be—keeping one foot in ideas that you might authentically be able to own and the other in ideas that are more aspirational. Assuming your brand strategy still feels relevant, look at the messages and visuals you are using in your communications, ask staff members to recite how they explain your organization, and push to see if you are being as clear and consistent as possible. </span><a href=""/brand_check_up"" target=""_blank""><span>Here’s a look at a similar process Sarah Durham led for the National Brain Tumor Society several years ago</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>3. Ask for a second opinion.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Just like many people will recommend you question an initial diagnosis from your doctor, getting the opinion of others is a crucial step as you review the health of your brand. Here is where you want to test internal perceptions against external ones. Consider conducting a few phone interviews, an online survey, or a focus group among people who know you. You might also reach out to a few people who don’t know you but should. Use these conversations or questions to learn how others see you and who they say you are. You might also benefit from asking colleagues at similar organizations how they define your organization in relation to who they are and your overall field. It may feel awkward to do this, but trust me</span><span>—</span><span>your peers, donors, current or future staff, board members, and others are asking those organizations how you compare, too, and hearing what they say can be hugely helpful in understanding how well you are (or are not) in tune with your desired positioning and personality. These exchanges with your community and your peers is also a great moment to ask or test how compelling or engaging you are. It’s no longer enough for people to understand </span><span>what</span><span> you are about</span><span>—</span><span>they need to also understand and connect to the </span><span>why</span><span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>4. Diagnose and prescribe: retrain, refresh or rebrand.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Time to gather your brand review committee, determine how healthy your brand is, and recommend a next step. We typically see three outcomes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You are fit as a fiddle</em><span><em>.</em> How you communicate on the outside still seems to match who you are on the inside. Your desired perception is generally in line with your reputation. Congratulations! As you enjoy a moment of pride, make sure to also keep up the great work. Keep your brand alive through regular trainings at staff meetings, periodic reviews of your style guide, and ongoing application of your brand strategy as a decision-making tool for your communications.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You could be doing better</em><span><em>.</em> The way others see you is only somewhat aligned with who you are. Take a deep breath and hone in on what parts of your brand or communications are not working and give them a tune-up. Maybe your core identity (name, tagline, and logo) still ring true, but your messaging is off. Or perhaps your approach to using images tells the story of who you used to be and not who you are now. Figure out what may be broken and give it a refresh.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You are unhealthy and need help, stat!</em><span> Those who know you well get it, but there is confusion among members of your community or peers. And those who don’t know you but should, have a hard time understanding what you are all about. It can be difficult to admit that your communications are not doing all they can to advance your mission, raise money, increase visibility, and create change. Fret not, we are here for you! First, double-check your assumption that </span><a href=""/consider-timing-when-branding"" target=""_blank""><span>it might be time for a rebrand with this handy decision-making tool</span></a><span>. Then get buy-in from your colleagues and </span><a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-reasons"" target=""_blank""><span>make the case for rebranding</span></a><span>. Once everyone agrees, consider bringing in an outside consultant, agency, or volunteer to lead a rebranding process and support your efforts to make significant changes to your brand and communications.&nbsp;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-0b2fdb93-e190-fd56-8175-74135fdbf2b2""><span>If you are wondering how we might help give your brand a checkup or rebrand your nonprofit, just drop a note to </span><a href=""mailto:hello@bigducknyc.com""><span>hello@bigducknyc.com</span></a><span> and we’ll be happy to chat.</span></span></span></p>

<p>When an organization is rebranding, the board’s involvement is critical, and, to be totally honest, very tricky. The board needs to feel confident that the organization’s new brand and communications materials are reflective of their point of view, which can be very different from staff’s. Staff members want to shape and direct the new brand because they have to live with it. They also know from experience what will and won’t work, in practical terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The culture and dynamics of board meetings can play an unexpectedly big role in how branding–or, really any–work is received and responded to. We’ve seen boards embrace the improbable, reject ideas the staff felt confident would be a slam-dunk, and surprise us in various ways over the years. The one conclusion I’ve safely drawn is that thinking about when, how, and who works with the board is often as important as the work itself.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips I’ve found really help keep a rebranding process focused and productive while giving the board a voice in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">1.&nbsp;Include a few key board members in the process, and expect them to promote it to the rest of the board.</h3>
<p>When we’re helping an organization go through our <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">brandraising process</a>, we often collaborate with a committee that includes both staff and board members. Ideally, that committee is small but mighty, and has the authority to approve the work, too.</p>
<p>The ideal committee has 5-10 people on it. It includes the executive director, head of development, head of communications, board chair, and perhaps other highly respected board members (ideally ones with marketing or fundraising clout).</p>
<p>Board members on this committee should know that their role is a two-way street; they are the bridge between the work and the board. They will represent board members' opinions and views to make sure work reflects the board’s unique perspective (not just their own individual perspective). Secondly, they will communicate back to the board about the work, ideally explaining it and advocating for it. When questions emerge, they might ‘workshop’ something with other board members, seeking advice or input where helpful, and reporting back to the committee.</p>
<p>Last year, we worked with a particularly fabulous board member during one rebrand. He not only offered useful suggestions at the committee level, but he presented the work effectively to his board colleagues, explained it, and fought for it, when needed. He was deeply engaged in the process, passionate about keeping it focused on the best ideas, and willing to fight for it. We love that guy! Much more importantly, the end result was much stronger because of him.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">2.&nbsp;Invite the board’s honest feedback at key junctures along the way.</h3>
<p>Nobody likes big surprises or to be told about decisions made long ago that affect them deeply. On the other hand, involving everyone everywhere is inefficient and will take much longer than necessary. Worse than that, it typically leads to everyone’s ideas getting Frankensteined together, creating a veritable monster you’ll probably regret.</p>
<p>Have the people involved in the process keep the board in the loop along the way by reporting at board meetings, calling people with updates, or sending emails. Ideally, look for places where the work is far enough along that you feel it’s on the right track but not totally done, and invite their feedback.</p>
<p>We recently presented draft vision, mission, and values statements at an organization’s board meeting. The drafts were close, but not quite done, so it was the perfect time to get a fresh perspective on them. After the strategy and process were explained to the board, the executive director and board members involved in the process added their support for the work and asked for candid feedback. Board members chimed in with what they liked and what they felt might be missing. Ideas were explored and debated. The next draft integrated the ideas the executive director supported. When the final version was presented to the full board, it felt familiar, reflective of that earlier discussion, and the board already understood the thinking behind it. After a brief discussion and thanks to the committee for their hard work on it, it was approved by the full board for adoption.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">3.&nbsp;Tell your board where they get to offer input–and where they don’t.</h3>
<p>I recently presented at a board meeting where my job was to update the board on a process that involved comprehensive changes to their messaging and visual identity. Before I began my presentation, the executive director did something we ask every client to do: she set me up for success. She reminded the board why they’d hired Big Duck in the first place, underscored her confidence in our expertise, and reminded the board that while they are Captains of Industry, the firm they’d hired are Captains of Nonprofit Communications. She told them the board’s role was to offer feedback and reactions, not to suggest colors or wordsmith. “We’ve hired people who do this for a living,” she reminded them, “and our conversations with you should be focused on a higher level.”</p>
<p>It worked like a charm. The board was focused, offered great feedback about what they liked and what concerned them. We left with a clear sense of where we had their support, where more work was needed, and what refinements should be made.</p>
<p>No matter who’s presenting, helping the board stay focused on when and how they get to play a role in the process is productive. Many people, especially board members who are less experienced in the ways of nonprofits, appreciate the guidance on when and how to offer input.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>After months of deep thinking and hard work, the last thing that anyone wants is for the plan to sit in a file cabinet somewhere, unused, and for everything to return to business as usual (unless, of course, you’re not thrilled with the outcome of the plan. Then, you’ve got another problem on your hands).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So, how can you make sure that your strategic plan is kept alive among staff, board, and other key stakeholders?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At Big Duck, we’ve found that a strategic plan can be more than just an internal planning document for staff and board. In fact, it can be a powerful tool for involving stakeholders of all types — from donors, partners, and other participants and constituents who are engaged and excited about the future of your organization. We think there’s a lot to be said about using communications strategy (and smart design and copy) to breath life into your strategic plan.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""/lfny-strategic-plan-rollout-materials"" target=""_blank"">Last year, we had the pleasure of working with Lycée Français de New York,</a> an independent school that blends French and American bilingual education to prepare students to&nbsp;be thinkers, innovators and leaders. We worked together to excite their community of parents, faculty, staff, and Trustees about the changes the school would be making as a result of their strategic plan, to make sure everyone understood what those changes would be, and to inspire people to use the plan as a compass to guide decisions and future planning.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After we got to know Lycée Français de New York and got a strong sense of the school’s vision for the future, we honed in on a few ways we could leverage the power of communications to bring LFNY’s strategic plan to life. Below are three tips your organization should keep in mind the next time you find yourself rolling out a strategic plan:</span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span><span><strong>1. Make it digestible.</strong> </span><span>Take into consideration the actual structure and format of the plan itself. If your audience can’t easily approach the information, you’re already off to a rough start. </span><span>We restructured Lycée Français de New York’s </span><span>plan, simplifying and reorganizing the content around five clear themes. &nbsp;What started as a massive Word document, became a tool </span><span>that would be useful for decision-making and ongoing reference. It’s now more memorable and easier to read and talk about.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Make it look good (and on-brand, of course). </strong></span><span>The materials you develop to help share your plan with internal and external audiences are hugely important. Take care in creating them and making them consistent with your overall brand.</span><span> </span><span>The poster, pamphlet (with both English and a French translations), and presentation </span><a href=""http://www.lfny.org/en/index.php/about_lfny/strategic_plan""><span>we built for </span><span>Lycée Français de New York </span></a><span>helped tell the story of the plan in a clear, engaging way.</span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span><span><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Make sure you’ve got the right tools. </strong></span><span>It’s crucial you have the appropriate tools to get your community on board and up to date on the progress of the plan. You might need to develop talking points, consider channels to use for sharing the plan, and more. For example, w</span><span>e worked with Lycee Francais de New York to hammer out a strategy for the rollout that included a roadmap for communicating updates about the strategic plan over the next few years.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Making a big hype about your strategic plan isn’t necessary for every organization, especially if the changes in the plan are not dramatic ones. But, after a strategic plan is developed—or even better, as it’s being developed— every nonprofit should ask two key questions: Who really needs to know about the plan? And what do you need to do in order to make sure those people understand and are energized by it? The answer to those questions will help you determine if you need to do some work to make your plan more accessible, or if keeping it in its current form works well enough.</span></p>

It’s an issue I care deeply about<span>—</span>as do many of my fellow Ducks. That’s why I was thrilled to start Big Duck’s first-ever Skip Lunch Fight Hunger team.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A little background: <a href=""http://www.cityharvest.org"" target=""_blank"">City Harvest</a> has been running the Skip Lunch Fight Hunger campaign for over ten years to raise money to fight child hunger.&nbsp;I’d already heard from my colleagues who worked with City Harvest on this project that they are an awesome organization running an amazing campaign (<a href=""/city-harvest-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">take a closer look at Big Duck’s work with City Harvest here</a>). Getting the chance to become involved myself was so, so exciting.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So here’s how it worked...</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Receive the welcome packet from City Harvest, filled with awesome stickers, a lunch bag to collect donations with, and a super cool poster. The Ducks fought over the goodies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Phase 2: </strong>Get to work. After some gentle nudging and emailing, soon everyone had <a href=""http://www.kintera.org/faf/search/searchTeamPart.asp?ievent=1131605&amp;supId=0&amp;extSiteType=4&amp;team=6289009"">joined the Big Duck Team</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Phase 3:</span></strong><span> Donate and spread the word. In addition to donating money ourselves, we shared our page with friends and family, squeezing money out of them and asking them to send our page around. What we discovered: some Ducks, it turns out, are more popular on social media than others.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step 4:</strong> Eat lunch. As an incentive to get the rest of the team as excited about Skip Lunch as I am, I coordinated a team lunch from Shake Shack (yum) halfway through the campaign week. Nothing like crinkly fries and milkshakes to get people feeling generous<span>—</span>we raised $611 by the end of the day!</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Keep it up. We have one day left and things are looking good. Maybe I’m biased, but I think the Big Duck team is the best. team. ever.</p>

Whatever the reason, people seem to be abandoning the corporate sector more and more in order to work in or consult with nonprofits.</p>
<p>We Ducks increasingly encounter professionals who are learning the ropes of the nonprofit sector on the job. Personally, I’m excited to see more people rolling up their sleeves and doing socially conscious work--but diving into new areas often presents new challenges.</p>
<p>If you’re newer to the nonprofit sector, here are three critical ways nonprofits are surprisingly different.</p>
<p><b>1. Buy-in means everything.</b> In many for-profits, there’s a small group of decision-makers. Nonprofits, by contrast, often engage staff and board in working groups or committees, solicit feedback, and even adopt consensus models.&nbsp; Early on in any project, make a point to find out who needs to be involved, when, and how.</p>
<p><b>2. Audiences are deeply diverse.</b> Most nonprofits have to keep the interests of extremely varied stakeholders in mind with every project. The people a nonprofit serves (its clients) are often entirely separate from those that support its work (officials, foundations, donors, and corporations). A nonprofit’s board, staff, and peers will often add perspectives that should be considered too. In the for-profit world where a specific target audience is usually identified and prioritized, these diverse audiences can be hard to engage fully, but are critical to account for.</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp;</b><b>Big or small, everyone’s scrappy</b>. Few nonprofit organizations budget for expenses the same way for-profits do—even the big guys. That means projects may have no budget allocated for expenses such as conducting research, media buying, travel, or other items that might be typical line-items in a for-profit context. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make the switch into the nonprofit sector or plan to work more deeply with nonprofits in the future, <strong>my webinar on July 16 will dig deeper into these topics</strong>: I’ll share ways to structure getting buy-in, explain how to map nonprofit stakeholder audiences, and other tips and tricks. <a href=""/how-to-advise-and-consult-with-nonprofits-1"" target=""_blank"">Details are online here</a>.&nbsp;I hope the webinar will save you or someone you love some serious time and help you do more successful work.</p>

But guess what? By early June, many nonprofits are already starting to plan for year-end fundraising season—and by fall, they're finalizing plans and getting campaigns rolling. Here's three things you can do now to help you be ready when September rolls around:</p>
<p><strong>Get into the year-round groove.</strong> Farra's <a href=""/engaging-donors-for-year-round-fundraising"">webinar about keeping your donors engaged year-round</a> shares some great tools and tactics you can use to keep the donor love alive all summer (and year) long, and make it easier to ask for money downstream. The <a href=""/engaging-donors-for-year-round-fundraising"">free recording</a>'s an hour long, but she also wrote a <a href=""/retaining-donors-all-year-long"">blog post on the topic</a> if you've only got a few minutes. She's also giving a <a href=""/contentmgr/It%20seems%20like%20just%20last%20week%20we%20were%20shivering%20through%20a%20cold%20winter-spring%20(oh%20wait,%20it%20was).%20But%20guess%20what?%20By%20late%20May,%20many%20nonprofits%20are%20already%20starting%20to%20plan%20for%20year-end%20fundraising%20season—and%20by%20fall,%20they're%20finalizing%20plans%20and%20getting%20campaigns%20rolling.%20"" target=""_blank"">free webinar on June 16</a> that will dig into some more year-end fun.</p>
<p><strong>Tune up your fundraising machine.</strong>&nbsp;Sarah's laundry list of <a href=""/seven-ways-to-tune-up-your-fundraising-this-summer"">7 ways to tune up your fundraising this summer</a>&nbsp;offers a great checklist. In particular, thinking about whether and how you'll segment differently and test this year is a good practice in the summer months. Liz's post on <a href=""/are-you-ready-to-segment"">laying the groundwork for segmenting</a> is a helpful read.</p>
<p><strong>Check up on your brand.</strong> Your year-end fundraising campaign should be an experience of your organizational brand—and if your overall brand and communications are in a rough place, it's much harder to effectively use it to fundraise. This <a href=""/timetorebrand"">handy infographic helps you answer: Is it time to rebrand</a>? Even if it's not time for an overhaul, now can be a good time to <a href=""/conduct-a-brand-check-up"">give it a quick check-up</a> using Farra's four steps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, of course...</p>

We recently chatted with Rinku Sen, Executive Director of Race Forward, to find out what pieces of wisdom she has to share with other organizations going into a rebranding process. Here’s what Rinku highlighted:</p>","<p dir=""ltr"">A few years ago, Big Duck was approached by the Applied Research Center (ARC), now <a href=""https://www.raceforward.org/about"" target=""_parent"">Race Forward</a>, about <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">helping them rebrand</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Race Forward is a fantastic organization working to build awareness, solutions, and leadership for racial justice. They publish the daily news site Colorlines and present Facing Race, the country’s largest multiracial conference on racial justice.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When they hired Big Duck, they were flying under the radar. The ARC brand was less well-known than the Colorlines brand<span>—</span>a real problem for their organizational communications. To really advance racial justice, they needed a brand that would set them apart and engage audiences on many levels.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To get the job done, we took their team through an <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">all-day brandraising intensive</a>&nbsp;and coached them as their staff implemented our recommendations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We recently caught up with Rinku Sen, Executive Director of Race Forward, to find out what advice she has to share with other organizations who are going into a rebranding process. Here’s what Rinku recommends:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Think strategically.</strong> &nbsp;The decision to change their organization's name coincided with a fundamental shift in how Race Forward (then ARC) was representing--and communicating about<span>—</span>itself. &nbsp;As Rinku says, “Politically, we are [now] very explicit about our racial justice commitment. &nbsp;We’re trying to remove the silencing effect of color blindness on racial discourse. We were pursuing a political strategy by pursuing a mouthy name.” &nbsp;Their new name was addressing this pivot head-on.</li>
</ol><ol start=""2"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Engage your staff and key stakeholders.</strong> &nbsp;“If they're unhappy, the process and the subsequent change is going to be miserable. If they’re engaged, it will be a better process because the new brand will be really connected to your organization’s history. You’re less likely to have re-do’s.” <a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-reasons"" target=""_blank"">Getting the right people on board</a> with the rebranding effort can make things move along much more smoothly. Not only do your key stakeholders have real insight into the history and mission of your organization, getting them involved throughout the process will help mitigate any tension after the launch of your rebrand.</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start=""3"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Take advantage of your organization’s own communications capabilities.</strong> &nbsp;After arriving at a brand strategy with Big Duck’s help, Race Forward took on the implementation of the rebrand in-house. By allowing the process to be fun and creative, the team at Race Forward ended up feeling a real sense of ownership over their rebrand, and effectived changes on many levels. Of course, not every organization has the capacity to take on the volume Race Forward did, but keep an eye out for opportunities to create or refine elements of your brand in-house.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir=""ltr"">A lot of Rinku’s advice comes down to making sure you’ve got your ducks in a row before jumping into a rebrand.<a href=""/timetorebrand"" target=""_blank""> Take a look at this infographic</a> to help decide if the time is right to make some real communications changes at your nonprofit.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Math for America offered valuable Master Teacher fellowships to help public school math and science teachers hone their skills, yet they were getting fewer qualified applications than they’d expected. What turned the numbers around? Launching a subway ad campaign that focused on the program’s core strengths helped convince the right teachers to take notice and start applying. We're in the campaign's second year (<a href=""/math-for-america-teacher-recruitment"" target=""_blank"">take a look at year one here</a>), and they've seen a nearly 400% uptick in applications.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Do you have an existing campaign you think has the potential to pack a bigger punch, given the right creative? City Harvest knows what you mean.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Over almost 15 years, City Harvest—a food rescue organization in New York—had built up an amazing following for their Skip Lunch Fight Hunger campaign. The idea was simple: for one week in May, City Harvest challenged New Yorkers to donate the cost of one lunch out to feed hungry NY kids. The campaign had built up an impressive amount of momentum among corporate volunteers—but the team felt it needed fresh new creative to really make a splash with the public.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Enter their new “This is how New Yorker’s Power Lunch” concept—which Big Duck helped the team develop and launch in a series of ads, emails, and recruitment events. Launching just this May, response has already been strong. <a href=""/city-harvest-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">See how this campaign refresh worked—</a>and start dreaming up your own campaign facelifts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Need to engage supporters on every level? </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Do you offer lots of ways to support your mission, but lack a cohesive way to pull people into a central campaign? Brooklyn Public Library is a great example of how, with smart planning and a unified campaign look, your next campaign can take your supporter engagement to the next level.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>During the spring city budget season, Brooklyn Public Library introduced a series of ways supporters could rally for better funding and support their local libraries—people could attend their Bike the Branches tour of Brooklyn, send a letter to City Hall, or make a donation to the library. So the wheels were in motion, but the team felt that a stronger, more cohesive look could help them see even better results.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s where Big Duck was thrilled to come in. We developed a unified campaign logo, look, and visual language that played up the library’s Brooklyn “cool,” and helped the team find strategic opportunities to lead supporters through all three calls to action. The campaign has continued to grow and thrive.&nbsp;</span><a href=""/awareness-and-fundraising-campaign-for-brooklyn-public-library"" target=""_blank""><span>Take a closer look at how we pulled it all together here.</span></a></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>No matter your engagement challenge, a more robust campaign plan and creative can be a critical tool in beefing up response—just ask Math for America, City Harvest, or Brooklyn Public Library! So don’t let year-end fervor distract you from the wonderful world of year-round campaigning—the possibilities are endless.</span></p>

<p>I’ll be honest- I’ve always been a little leery of organizational values. Frequently, these seem to be HR-driven campaigns to increase employee excitement, and, to be honest, they can sound more than a little cheesy. After all, who has time to spend thinking about what we value internally as an organization with pressing time-sensitive projects to complete?</p>
<p>After a couple of months working at GuideStar, however, I realized that I couldn’t have been more wrong! GuideStar’s values are what we refer to as the&nbsp;<strong>“4 Cs:” Clarity, Compassion, Courage and Collaboration.</strong>&nbsp;They are a core piece of how, what, and why we do the things we do. These “4 Cs” reflect the common beliefs of those of us who represent our organization, and also play a key role in our overall brand and brand platform.</p>
<p>Organizational values are incredibly helpful when presented with tough work situations. Here are just a couple of ways that I’ve used the GuideStar values of Clarity, Compassion, Courage, and Collaboration to help me in my work life:</p>
<p><strong>1. To deal with tricky personal issues&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Personal issues, such as personality mismatches, are both extremely common in the workplace and hugely detrimental to productivity. For the times when people vehemently disagree on how something should be done based on their own perspectives, it can be quite useful to point to your organizational values as a framing device for curbing unruly or disruptive behavior that hinders moving projects forward. For example, it is much easier to talk to someone about their inappropriate sarcasm in meetings by mentioning to them that one of your core organizational values is<strong>&nbsp;compassion.&nbsp;</strong>This way, both the offender and offended can discuss sticky situations with a common language that is neither personal nor attacking, but rather solutions-oriented and positive.</p>
<p><strong>2. To bring up a new point of view&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When bringing up a new or unpopular point of view on a project, your organization’s value system can be a really helpful tool. For example, if I disagree with my supervisors at a meeting, I can always lean on the assurance that our organization supports showing<strong>courage</strong>&nbsp;when explaining my point of view. This empowers&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;feel like I have permission to always speak my mind to superiors– our values encourage us to do so!</p>
<p><strong>3. To make strategic decisions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Recently, a colleague and I were trying to decide whether to include more people in several feedback sessions we were hosting. She correctly pointed out that at GuideStar, we strive to&nbsp;<strong>collaborate</strong>. As this is one of our organizational values, the answer was clear – invite them in! The more, the merrier.</p>
<p>Of course, there are much larger implications that can come from adhering to our organizational values. Should we enter a partnership? Should we do business with this or that company? All of these questions are more easily answered by referring to our values, and whether this decision fits into them.</p>
<p>Does your organization have internal values? How do you think about your organization’s values when making decisions at work? Let us know!</p>

","Sarah Durham","1050","","<p>National or international organizations with local chapters are understandably concerned about speaking with one voice, while local chapters are concerned with making that voice feel relevant and personalized for their community.</p>","<p>As an agency that regularly works with local, national, and international organizations, we often find ourselves in conversations about how the brand shakes out at these different levels. National or international organizations with local chapters are understandably concerned about speaking with one voice, while local chapters are concerned with making that voice feel relevant and personalized for their community.</p>
<p>I don’t believe there’s a one-size-fits-all approach for these sorts of challenges, but there are plenty of great examples of nonprofits who have made it work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Branding locally without abandoning the mother brand</b></p>
<p>One of my recent favorite examples of smart local-org branding is <a href=""http://www.unitedwayaustin.org/"">United Way for Greater Austin</a>. &nbsp;If you’ve ever been there, you know that Austin, Texas is no typical town. It’s hip, musical, and digital—full of Millenials who’ve moved there for its vibrant community, Google Fiber connectivity, and great food. United Way Capital Area, as it was once called, wanted their brand to reflect the unique spirit and culture of their community, and to help people see that they are a great way to support Austin.</p>
<p>Working with a local firm, they changed their name and approach to imagery, and launched a “(fill in the blank) makes Austin greater” campaign, which is evergreen. Keeping the United Way name and logo kept them connected to their well-known national mother brand. Today, their in-house team of savvy marketers consistently communicate that United Way for Greater Austin is the best way to support their vibrant city. They’re telling a great local story while leveraging their national parent’s name-recognition and equity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Top-down branding from National</b></p>
<p>When a national organization with local chapters rolls out a new visual identity or messaging, the challenge is getting people at every level excited to use it. Key to getting people “on the bus” is making it easy for them—ideally, easier than continuing to maintain their own separate identity.</p>
<p>Frequently, larger organizations do this by providing support and customized tools to help local chapters get what they need without spending their own staff’s time or budget. Organizations like <a href=""http://www.jewishfederations.org/"">Jewish Federations of North America</a>, <a href=""https://www.girlscouts.org/"">Girl Scouts</a>, <a href=""http://www.boystown.org/"">Boys Town</a>, and others not only provide clear branding guidelines their local colleagues can use, they often provide staff support, too.</p>
<p>Some national organizations send their communications team from HQ on the road, working in local offices with staff to train them, answer questions, and help them solve the problems that changes inevitably surface. Others provide support by having their national marketing team produce whatever local needs to get up to speed, including their own versions of logo, messaging, brochures, or digital templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Adapting the brand for international use</b></p>
<p>In global or international organizations, there’s an additional layer of complexity to tackle: cultural competency. A message that works well in one country might sound completely tone-deaf in another. (Remember when Chevy rolled out the Nova in Mexico, people?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Big Duck rebranded <a href=""http://www.masaisrael.org/"">Masa Israel North America</a>, their international CEO at the time, Ayelet Shiloh-Tamir, participated in the process as an observer and interviewee--but she let the North American Executive Director make all the decisions to ensure the work was culturally compatible with the US. Afterwards, Ayelet shared the changes North America was making with directors in other countries to gauge their reactions.</p>
<p>Over time, most of Masa Israel’s international offices adopted the brand changes that North America pioneered, although many made adjustments to discreet elements, like the tagline, to make it work locally with an authentic voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first blush, it may seem counter-intuitive that “listening” is more important than “telling,” “suggesting,” or “asking.”</p>

<p>“<span>So many nonprofits send bad thank you letters – if they send them at all! Nonprofit thank you letters need to be thought of as a very important, highly strategic piece of communication.</span><br /><br /><span>A thank you is NOT just a tax receipt. It should look like a personal letter from one friend to another. Ditch the predictable openings like “Thank you for your gift of…” or “On behalf of our organization…” Draw in the donor immediately by placing them front and center.

<p>One of the best places to promote sharing is on your “thank you” pages. These are the first pages donors see after clicking “donate”, so the likelihood they’ll share the campaign is relatively high.”</p>

Wouldn’t it be great if your donors felt inspired to do the same thing for your nonprofit?</p>
<p>While we may not want to encourage too much shirt-ripping, the notion that a donor can reveal their true commitment and make a big difference is heady stuff. And capital campaigns do just that: give donors an inspiring new way to demonstrate their support and make their own mark on your organization.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to inspire your donors to reveal their superhero-like passion for your work and inspire them to go further in your capital campaign. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Let them investigate, pen in hand, and write their own story.</b> Your lead gifts are more likely to come from people you’ve engaged in meaningful one-on-one conversations, regardless of whether or not you give them a sexy brochure. Remember that during the early phases of a campaign, when leadership and major gifts are being solicited, conversations are key.</p>
<p>Invite their ideas for the campaign and input on the case for support in draft form, and you’ll find they’re more likely to invest. They’re also likely to suggest terrific ideas that shape the story you’ll tell to other donors. Downstream, if you print that fancy case statement, they’ll recognize their influence on it and may be more likely to want to help you solicit other donors as a result.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><b>Help them develop supersonic vision and see what’s beyond the horizon.</b> Too often, capital campaign communications focus only on the specific, tangible items the campaign will fund (e.g. that facility you’ll build), and it all ends up sounding a bit dry or dull. A case for support should specify how funds raised will be used in the short-term, but emphasize the benefits or outcomes they’ll create over time. Constructing that new building, for example, will create a state-of-the-art learning facility that allows teachers to do their best work, students to learn in inspiring environments, and provide more space for local students to get a top-tier education close to home. Those benefits are what they’re really supporting– not the construction of a facility.</p>
<p><b>3. Build on your own superhero brand.</b> Your campaign has to tell a compelling story and invite donors to go above and beyond their regular support. At the same time, we also want to build on their history and loyalty to your organization. Use copy and design elements that reinforce the idea that this is all still coming from the organization they feel connected to, while weaving in a new theme that strikes at the heart of what this specific campaign is all about. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We know from data found in&nbsp;<a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">The Rebrand Effect</a>&nbsp;that a rebrand can, in some cases, improve donor retention. But why does it happen, and how can we ensure that it happens every time?</p>
<p><strong>Why donors stay committed</strong></p>
<p>To understand what moves the retention needle, it's important to first understand why donors stay committed to an organization.</p>
<p>In his book Retention Fundraising, Roger Craver shares the results of a survey which asked respondents to rank, by order of importance, 32 drivers of donor commitment. Here were the top seven:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donor perceives your organization to be effective in trying to achieve its mission.</li>
<li>Donor knows what to expect from your organization with each interaction.</li>
<li>Donor receives timely a thank you.</li>
<li>Donor receives opportunities to make his or her views known.</li>
<li>Donor is given the feeling that he or she is part of an important cause.</li>
<li>Donor feels his or her involvement is appreciated.</li>
<li>Donor receives information showing who is being helped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than just settling for an increase in retention as a pleasant side effect to rebranding, you can make it a defined, desired outcome. Using the above list as a primer, here are three ways to increase donor loyalty during and after a rebrand:</p>
<p><strong>1. Involve stakeholders in the process</strong></p>
<p>Donors want to feel involved in how the nonprofits they support operate. A rebrand is a perfect opportunity to let donors make their views known.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to run every idea past your entire donor database, while struggling to come a consensus on the proposed new direction of the brand.</p>
<p>But you can gather ideas, via phone calls, electronic surveys and in-person meetings. Even if they do not respond, merely receiving a survey will make your constituents feel as though their feedback is valued. And, who knows, you may glean valuable insights and perspectives that you would not have thought to include in the process.</p>
<p><strong>2. Develop a culture of donor-centricity</strong></p>
<p>A rebrand isn't just about a new logo. It's an opportunity to transform your entire culture. If&nbsp;<a href=""https://bloomerang.co/retention"" target=""_blank"">donor retention</a>&nbsp;is something you struggle with, you may need to look beyond the window dressing and address how donor-centric your organization truly is.</p>
<p>A rebrand is a good time to re-evaluate how you steward donors. Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do our key performance indicators value donor retention over donor acquisition?</li>
<li>Does our team understand the cost associated with acquiring new donors versus retaining the ones we have?</li>
<li>Do we thank donors quickly and in a personal way? Is our board part of this process?</li>
<li>Do we have documented communications plans for each segment of donors, and do we follow through?</li>
<li>Do we make the donor the hero of the story in all of our communications?</li>
<li>Do we recognize donors publicly?</li>
<li>Do we resolve complaints quickly and in a satisfactory way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Few nonprofits experience high retention rates without being donor-centric. Strong leadership here is key; if your founder, executive director and board don’t value donors above all else, neither will your staff.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make mission impact a core value</strong></p>
<p>Looking at drivers #1, #5 and #7, it’s clear to see that donors want to know that your nonprofit doesn’t just talk to the talk, but also walks the walk.</p>
<p>Take the time to examine your outbound communications, as well as your marketing collateral, and look for opportunities to communicate the impact of your organization. Remember to always keep the donor at the center. After all, it’s their support that makes it all possible.</p>
<p>If the goals of your rebrand don’t include increased donor loyalty, it’s likely won’t happen. If you aren’t measuring your donor retention rates at all (less than half of all nonprofits are) resolving to start doing so is a great goal for a rebrand; one that will put you ahead of most organizations.</p>

As I reviewed the many options available, I paused to see if a <a href=""http://www.jdvhotels.com/"">Joie De Vivre</a> hotel was a possible option. To my delight, this lovely boutique chain has two hotels in Honolulu, and a lovely room was available at the <a href=""http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/hawaii/shoreline-hotel-waikiki/"">Shoreline Hotel Waikiki</a>—a hotel which embodied a relaxing, joyful vibe, aka the spirit of aloha, at a price we could afford.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You may be wondering if this is going to be a really long hotel review (I promise, it’s not) or what this has to do with nonprofit communications (I promise, it does).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Speaking to the latter, I think my fundraising friends could learn a lot from how this hotel builds relationships with people. I’m not sure if other people have compared hotel guest communication with nonprofit donor communication—but their may be a hidden connection. Think about it. There are lots of hotels to choose from and they have lots of people that come in and out of their virtual and physical doors. While they have to communicate to lots of people, all of the time, the best experiences are the ones where guests feel special—like someone really cared about their satisfaction and made sure they had everything they needed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like all of us consultants out there often suggest, this organization made sure to <a href=""http://deliveringhappiness.com/"">deliver happiness</a> (nod to Zappos somewhat intentional) at every touch point—from before we checked-in through after we checked out. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img border=""0"" src=""/stuff/contentmgr/files/2/4f122ece7d0aaefc358e46a40750a266/files/_resized/80_1000_495_maslow_customer_service_1024x507.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""248"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">My interest in a Joie De Vivre hotel stemmed from reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Peak-Companies-Maslow-non-Franchise-Leadership/dp/0787988618/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a"">PEAK: How Great Companies get their Mojo from Maslow</a>, by the hotel chain’s founder and CEO, Chip Conley. We’ve passed the book around at Big Duck and have been doing a lot of talking about how we can deliver transformative experiences to our clients and colleagues—surpassing success and meeting unrecognized needs. We’ve even applied this thinking to <a href=""/give-your-audiences-the-most-with-annual-report"">how nonprofits can engage donors with their annual report</a>. I wondered what it would be like to experience this philosophy first-hand, and sure, I was also curious to see how much they embodied their mantra to “Create Joy.” I even squeezed in an interview with one of their staff (more about that below.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After booking the room, I made sure to sign up for the rewards program, the <a href=""http://www.joyoflifeclub.com/"">Joy of Life Club</a>, where I was soon invited to fill out some information about my preferences as part of their Dreammaker program. I later discovered they used this information to upgrade our room and customize the welcome greeting (a lovely bottle of wine). <a href=""http://www.hvs.com/article/4437/joie-de-vivre-and-the-art-of-the-hotel/"">As described by this case study</a>, “Dreammaker services are meant to meet a guest's needs or desires even before they're voiced. Transcending Joie de Vivre's standards for exemplary guest service, employees are encouraged to pull a 'dreammaker' act for a loyal, repeat guest or one who'd seem willing to spread the word.” Clearly these are techniques to deepen customer loyalty (cue donor retention), so I wondered what else they’d do to go out of their way to bring us joy.</p>

<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It didn’t take long for me to find out. The front desk staff always wore a smile, and many greeted us by our first names (yay for personalization!) They were sure to ask how our day was, and some even remembered bits of our conversation (of course I wondered if there was a database or CRM powering some of that shared knowledge).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">When I mentioned it was my partner’s birthday during our stay, not only did they give her a shout-out on their daily board, but they surprised us with an ice basket full of sake and chocolate accompanied by a lovely handwritten note. And one night, Mona (perhaps the most authentically friendly hotel staffperson I’ve ever met) <a href=""http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/561"">gave us a yummy cookie butter treat</a>—just because.

<p dir=""ltr"">Finally, I couldn’t help think about branding throughout my visit.

<p dir=""ltr"">I felt at home in Hawaii, while also connecting with the entire Joie De Vivre hotel chain—both during my stay and through the emails, tweets, and Facebook updates that followed.

She described their vision, mission and programs, many of which have a fee-for-service component. “We’re just over two years away from sustainability,” she said, describing their financial situation. Later in our conversation, she used another term I generally associate with start-up businesses, which got me thinking about the parrallels between a young nonprofit’s ability to build a sustainable income stream and a start-up business’s.</p>","<p>I recently met someone who works at a nonprofit that was founded four years ago. She described their vision, mission and programs, many of which have a fee-for-service component. “We’re just over two years away from sustainability,” she said, describing their financial situation.</p>
<p>Later in our conversation, she used another term I generally associate with start-up businesses, which got me thinking about the parrallels between a young nonprofit’s ability to build a sustainable income stream and a start-up business’s.</p>
<p>For-profit businesses, like most of their nonprofit counterparts, tend to get started on a wing and prayer, often with people going to heroic lengths to bring to life an idea that others may not believe will work. Founders work doggedly to establish their products, services, and programs, and demonstrate their value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A start-up founder with a good idea, just like a nonprofit founder, must inspire others to invest in her vision. For-profit entrepreneurs can seek seed funding, angel investing, or give away equity to get their project launched. Nonprofit entrepreneurs often enlist volunteers, get foundation support, or engage donors (often, ones they know personally) to underwrite the work.</p>
<p>At some point, though, both businesses need to survive without the help of insiders. In a for-profit business, that means generating enough income to surpass expenses, hopefully with a healthy profit margin. The business stops leaning on the kindness of family and friends and begins to lean on its own products and services to survive and grow.</p>
<p>But do nonprofits also develop the same independent self-reliance as they move beyond their founder? Over the years, I’ve seen a few that do, and many that continue under unstable financial conditions year after year. Often, organizations shift their reliance from the founder’s connections over to a new funding source that may be less personal, but may not be wholly stable, such as foundation grants.</p>
<p>Nonprofits who become independent or grow rapidly benefit from diversifying their revenue streams just like you, as an investor, have less risk when you invest your money personally in diverse ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A diversified income portfolio at a nonprofit might have events-based income, receive grants from foundations and/or the government, and have a pool of major donors. Or maybe it has some earned income programs and a robust annual program and supporting donor pipeline.</p>
<p>Got tips for leaders at younger nonprofits? Disagree? I’m all ears.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1","Fundraising ideas","This blog for not-for-profits looks at start-ups as a model for fundraising ideas.

<p><em>Pitched with&nbsp;John Mix, Director of Data and Systems Analytics at International Rescue Committee and Judi Sohn, Open Source Community Manager at Salesforce Foundation&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When it comes to communicating with your audiences, customization is king. The more personalized your outreach is, the more likely your audience is to take the action you're asking them to take. We've seen for-profits doing this for a while--they gather data on customers and turn that data into targeted communications that reach specific groups at specific times, through specific channels.</p>
<p>So how can nonprofits take a page from the for-profit book to deepen their audience engagement? This workshop will explore marketing automation software and CRM systems as tools for developing high-touch relationships—without maxing out your team's time, budget, and resources. We'll be sure to investigate strategy too! <a href=""http://16ntc.ideascale.com/a/dtd/High-Tech-for-High-Touch-Using-digital-tools-to-customize-your-supporter-engagement/119285-35237"" target=""_blank""><strong>VOTE HERE.</strong></a></p>

<p>Over the past 15 years, we've seen a real shift in how people communicate. There are now an overwhelming number of ways you can reach your donors, activists, volunteers, clients, and other members of the community. What’s the role of marketing and communications these days? What skills does your communications team need today, or what will they need tomorrow? How do you build a team with the right structure and size to manage?</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll explore how your communications department might work in the year 2020. We’ll investigate the roles, skills, and tools you will want to see in your staff. We'll provide a roadmap to help you build a staff of strong communicators, who can engage and coordinate the messages that donors and other audiences receive. Together we'll explore how to support and grow your current team; what new qualifications you might look for when making that next hire; and how to break down departmental silos and barriers. <a href=""http://16ntc.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Your-Communications-Team-in-2020-Are-you-ready-for-the-future/119278-35237"" target=""_blank""><strong>VOTE HERE.</strong></a></p>

Target audiences, particularly potential clients and supporters, did not always understand the focus of the organization, and Phipps CDC suspected this was getting in the way of growth. With a newly hired communications staff and a strategic plan in place, they were ready to change their communications, so they embarked on a rebranding process.&nbsp;</p>","<p><em>This piece was also featured by New York Nonprofit Media on June 23, 2015.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2012, Phipps CDC, a 40-year-old human services organization in the South Bronx, was struggling to communicate clearly, consistently and effectively. Target audiences, particularly potential clients and supporters, did not always understand the focus of the organization, and Phipps CDC suspected this was getting in the way of growth. With a newly hired communications staff and a strategic plan in place, they were ready to change their communications, so they embarked on a rebranding process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/urban-housing-organization-visuals"" target=""_blank"">The rebranding of Phipps CDC was comprehensive</a>, and included setting a brand strategy and changing their logo, tagline and name (they are now Phipps Neighborhoods). Key messages, boilerplate content and an elevator pitch were also created. Other elements were rewritten to be more engaging and the entire staff was trained to use this new suite of tools.</p>
<p>Today, Phipps Neighborhoods staffers say the rebranding was instrumental in helping them raise more private support. “It’s not necessarily direct; people don’t give because of the name or logo, but the brand elements help us to talk about the work more effectively,” said Nancy Riedl, Phipps Neighborhoods’ director of development and communications. “The new brand, the work we do, and the fundraising that supports it are all a system now.”</p>
<p>Branding is all about perception—how your nonprofit is perceived in the hearts and minds of the people who matter most. In today’s increasingly noisy world, nonprofits consider rebranding as a strategy to reach and engage clients and supporters more effectively. But does it really work like that for most nonprofits?</p>
<p>I decided to find out. Big Duck worked collaboratively with the FDR Group, a research firm, to develop an <a href=""/contentmgr/bigducknyc.com/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">unbiased study</a> comparing the outcomes of organizations that had rebranded with those that had made less dramatic communications changes in recent years. Rebranding was defined as changing or developing at least four of the following elements: brand strategy, name, tagline, logo, key messages and/or elevator pitch.</p>
<p>Our research revealed that organizations undertaking branding activities experienced many positive outcomes, including improved fundraising, donor retention and recruitment—just as Phipps Neighborhoods had. These organizations also did a better job engaging more activists, increasing program registration, recruiting better board members and garnering media attention.</p>
<p>About 1 in 4 survey participants said their organization’s ability to raise funds improved since implementing branding and communications changes. Virtually the same number said it was too soon to tell. For 36 percent, things had “stayed about the same,” while 6 percent said their organization’s ability to fundraise had gotten harder.</p>
<p>“(It’s) easier to tell the story … but still a difficult challenge raising money in a down economy,” one survey respondent said. Fundraising is “not easier, just more effective.”</p>
<p>Another respondent noted, “(Our) entire budget has been cut by 50 percent, including the fundraising budget. Direct mail campaigns, which were the backbone of our fundraising, are all but impossible now.”</p>
<p>Beyond this study, Big Duck has informally tracked the results of a number of nonprofits we have worked with over the past 20 years. The effects of getting smarter, faster and more confident as communicators seem to radiate outward, shifting an organization’s culture as staff members become more confident communicators and brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Often, it begins with staff members producing materials or writing appeals or speeches faster and better than before, frequently without freelancers or the outside support they used to rely on. Next, donors who had previously made smaller gifts are making larger gifts and saying that they perceive the organization has “gone to the next level.” For example, The Marfan Foundation, a national nonprofit headquartered in Long Island that <a href=""/the-marfan-foundation-brand"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck rebranded in 2013</a>, saw a 50 percent increase in overall support in their first year-end season using their new brand.</p>
<p>Rebranding a nonprofit is a lot like renovating your home: It’s messy, complicated, expensive and more time-consuming than you’d expect. But afterward, you feel more confident inviting people in. That’s where the fun begins—and the fundraising.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1413%2,1409%3,1410%4","Rebranding nonprofit to raise more money","This piece outlines the way changing messaging, visual identity, and other aspects of an organization's brand can improve fundraising efforts and donor engagement.

<p dir=""ltr"">I’ve enjoyed helping lots of nonprofits raise money from their community and the challenge of getting donors to invest in a particular project OR to transform donors into fundraisers (a practice typically referred to as social or peer-to-peer fundraising, but sometimes lumped into a crowdfunding discussion) is an exciting one. I also love donating to these type of campaigns, taking note of the story behind it, the set-up and ease of giving, and what the organization sends me throughout the lifespan of the project. Just this month, I’ve been drawn to the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/girl-scouts-is-foreverygirl"" target=""_blank"">#ForEVERYGirl campaign by the Girl Scouts of Western Washington</a> which took to one of the most popular crowdfunding site refusing to abide by a donor’s stipulation on a major gift. The campaign was simple with a clear tie to their mission, “Help us raise back the $100,000 a donor asked us to return because we welcome transgender girls.” And the results are phenomenal. In just one month, they raised over $300,000 from more than 7,000 people.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">As a Big Duck designer, I’m no stranger to the questions, “What’s a visual identity? And what’s a brand guide?” Your visual identity includes all of the visual aspects of your brand—<a href=""/professional_fundraising_marketing_and_logos_for_nonprofits?project_type=1134&amp;sector="" target=""_blank"">the logo, color palette, typography, and images</a> your organization uses when you communicate with your audiences. A brand guide is a hefty resource Big Duck puts together to help organizations make sure they’re using their visual elements in the right way, consistently. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">But what if you don’t have the resources for a full visual identity overhaul and brand guide development? &nbsp;Over the next few weeks, we’ll be walking you through some steps you can take to keep your communications looking fresh in our new “DIY Design” series. In this edition, we’re covering logo and color.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Polish your logo.</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Your logo is the face of your organization and can make a lasting impression on your audiences. It’s important to make sure your logo represents you well by keeping it consistent, high-quality, and professional. Making a few simple tweaks and setting some clear guidelines for its use will go a long way in establishing your visual identity and helping you communicate more effectively.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Never warp, stretch, rotate, or distort your logo in any way.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone is using your logo consistently across all channels. Set up some rules about how it should be sized and where the logo should be placed on a page or screen.</li>
<li>Decide on a final color palette for the logo, and always stick to it whenever you use the full-color version of the logo. Do the same for a black and/or grayscale version, as well as a negative version (white logo on a dark background).</li>
<li>Only use vector (eps or ai file formats) or hi-resolution raster (300 dpi or higher, jpg or png formats) images of your logo to avoid any blurriness or pixilation.</li>
<li>Never place your logo over complex, multi-colored imagery to ensure legibility and clarity.</li>
<li>Create a logo package so that your team has easy access to the right logo files for whatever project they’re working on. Try to include files for the standard logo as well as logo/tagline lockups (either vertical orientation, horizontal orientation, or both), and implement only those options across all materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Establish a color palette.</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Color is an easy and memorable way to bring your brand to life and communicate your organization’s personality at the same time. Having a selected color palette will ensure that your communications materials are more recognizable, look like they’re coming from the same organization, and speak to the right audiences.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for ways for color to express the personality of your organization and choose a palette that will differentiate you from your competitors.</li>
<li>Choose two or three primary colors that are from or work well with your logo. Just as with the typography, the color should always support your logo, not compete with it.</li>
<li>Choose three to five secondary colors that compliment the primary colors but are slightly more subtle.</li>
<li>Use the color consistently across all materials!</li>
<li>Remember: balance is key. Attention-grabbing color is great, but it only works if it stands out.</li>

<p>Branding. It doesn’t take an MBA to understand how critical it is. Good branding can elevate a company from successful to iconic, with the biggest brands—Apple, Coca-Cola, Nike—so well recognized they’re borderline cultural institutions. Bad branding can leave even the best-run business struggling to stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>But while for-profits long ago discovered its importance, branding remains low on the priority list for some nonprofits. That’s understandable—with so many nonprofits focused on development through tangible fundraising methods with measurable ROI, it’s easy to overlook something as abstract, as seemingly cosmetic, as branding.</p>
<p>That’s a mistake, but thankfully, it’s becoming a less common one. “Increasingly, what we have found is that more and more nonprofits are thinking about branding in a more reflective and smart way than ever before—and, particularly, seeing it as a strategy to communicate more clearly so they can build relationships mostly with individual donors,” said Sarah Durham, president of&nbsp;<a href=""/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Big Duck</a>, a communications firm based in New York City. “And that’s a big shift. I started Big Duck 21 years ago, and the first 10 years of the business I almost never even used the word branding. It was almost like a word that nonprofits found offensive. These days, I think that nonprofits understand that branding is really about reputation management.”</p>
<p>So, take a look at your nonprofit’s branding strategy. If it’s an afterthought—or even if it’s already high priority but in need of a refresh—it might be time to make it an integral part of your donor engagement strategy. It might be time to rebrand.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know before you do:</p>
<p><strong>Debunking the Myths</strong><br />Let’s start by clearing up two big branding myths—that it’s purely aesthetic, and that it’s hard to measure its effects. Neither is true, and buying heavily into either can hurt your rebranding efforts, or worse, discourage you from ever rebranding at all.</p>
<p>On aesthetics: Your logo is important, but it’s only a small part of the branding mix. “It really helps for people to understand that branding isn’t just about your logo, or even your logo and your messaging—it’s about everything you do internally and externally that impacts how people perceive you,” Durham explained. “And donors first and foremost have to have a positive sense of what the organization is and why they should support it.”</p>
<p>A great logo never hurts, but branding has to do more than look cool. It has to resonate with donors enough to compel them to your cause. Your nonprofit might have the slickest logo and the sharpest marketing, but if those elements aren’t part of a broader plan—a cohesive effort involving all parts of your organization working to communicate a singular message—your branding will fall flat.</p>
<p>Then there’s ROI. It’s difficult to quantify something like brand equity: How do you know it’s your branding strategy, and not, say, your superb product, that’s influencing customer loyalty? That, combined with the accompanying array of marketing jargon—vision statements, design grids, value propositions—makes it easy to dismiss branding as little more than an ill-defined marketing gimmick. Don’t overthink it—just look at the bottom line.</p>
<p>“We conducted this survey, working with a market research firm, that’s sort of a quantified look at what happens to nonprofits when they rebrand—what do they change, does it impact fundraising, does it impact recruitment into programs, all of that stuff,” said Durham. “One of the most interesting things we found in that study was that a lot of nonprofits had rebranded fairly recently, but those that had rebranded two years ago or more were seeing a sizeable shift in their ability to raise money. We saw that more than 50 percent of nonprofits that rebrand report that they’ve seen an increase in their revenue. […] That’s a very high number, especially compared to only 4 percent who say they’ve seen a decrease in revenue.”</p>
<p><strong>Is Your Organization Ready?</strong><br />How do you know when your organization is ready to rebrand? It varies from nonprofit to nonprofit, but Durham noted that most choose to rebrand when there’s a “transitional moment”—a leadership change, a new organizational strategy, a shift in focus. “So, what we experience is the time most nonprofits typically think about rebranding is when that happens—when something significant has changed and the way they’ve been communicating feels like it no longer fits,” she said.</p>
<p>“If your organization changes—if it gets older, if you have new leadership or a new strategic plan—and the way you’ve been communicating still works, great. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” she continued. “I never recommend a rebrand just as a matter of course. It’s not like getting your teeth cleaned—it’s a lot of work, and it can be time-consuming and disruptive and expensive, so you really don’t want to go through that kind of process unless what you’re going to get out of it on the other side is worth it.”</p>
<p><strong>Why Rebrand?</strong><strong><br /></strong>That’s the big question for nonprofits—is a rebrand worth it? Durham’s numbers suggest that it is, and so does the anecdotal evidence. Cure SMA, a charity dedicated to the treatment and cure of spinal muscular atrophy, a terminal disorder that affects children, is one of the charities Durham mentioned whose rebrand led to increased revenue. When Cure SMA approached Big Duck about rebranding, an issue was the organization’s then-name: Families of SMA. The charity had a strong footprint in the SMA parent and patient community, but it wanted to increase funding for research and was having difficulties reaching a broader donor audience.</p>
<p>“They needed people who are not necessarily directly affected by SMA to know what they do and feel compelled to want to support the cause. And so, when we took them through a rebranding process, we looked at all the ways they were communicating, what was working and what wasn’t,” Durham explained. “One of the things that came up in that was that their name, Families of SMA, was kind of restricting—it assumes you were directly affected. So we actually shifted their name over to something they had already been using, Cure SMA—that was their URL—and we just made Cure SMA the name of the organization.”</p>
<p>The name change, along with coordinated adjustments to the charity’s visuals, messaging, donor engagement strategy and&nbsp;<a href=""http://curesma.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">relaunched website</a>, paid off. “We were able to fundraise in the year-end season using all these new ideas, new messages, new tone and style. But effectively, the arc of the year-end appeal was not all that different from what they’d done before—it was really just a shift in the brand,” said Durham. “And we saw that their year-end numbers went up exponentially. They almost doubled, actually. They raised over $750,000—so, a really sizeable income increase—and those numbers were coming not only from old donors, but from new ones. So the strategy we set out in the rebrand was to bring new people into the Cure SMA community, and that appeal really showed that it could be done, that the new brand helped do it.”</p>
<p>Durham noted that this scenario—an organization outgrowing its name—is one of the most common reasons for a rebrand. The American Association for Retired Persons, she explained, now goes solely by its acronym, AARP, in an effort to reach an audience beyond retirees. “We see a lot of organizations that have those kinds of situations—they’re carrying around maybe language or ideas or visuals that are reflective of the past, not the future,” she said.</p>

<h3 class=""alt"">(Re)building the Foundation</h3>
<div class=""aside_content"">
<p>It goes without saying, but a total organizational rebrand is a massive undertaking. Success is largely determined early in the process, so before you think about selecting logo colors or agonize over serif versus sans serif fonts, make sure you’ve built a strong foundation for the process. Susannah Schaefer, CEO of the recently rebranded&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.smiletrain.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Smile Train</a>, offered a three-step blueprint for nonprofits in the early stages of a rebrand:</p>
<p><strong>1. Listen to your supporters.</strong><br />“Current and prospective supporters are your brand’s most vital audiences, making their opinions and perspectives key. When embarking on a rebrand strategy, engage your supporters in the process by asking them for honest feedback—what’s working and what’s not, how they most like to be reached, which tactics most resonate. Everything from surveys to one-on-one conversations can be highly useful in gathering meaningful insights from your base, paving the way to success with wider audiences.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Take the time to get it right.</strong><br />“A rebrand is an enormous undertaking and it’s important to start planning well in advance. Every step of the rebrand—from the research to the strategy to the message—should be approached with great thought and care, and with an eye toward your long-term vision. Dedicating time to getting it right can make all the difference in capturing the right eyes and fostering meaningful engagement with donors for years to come.”</p>
<p><strong>3. Define your goals.</strong><br />“Before executing your rebrand, benchmark your current relevant statistics and use them to set measurable goals and clearly define what success entails. This will allow you to evaluate your initiative at key checkpoints and, as needed, adjust your strategy so that you are best positioned to meet your goals. Among our goals for the rebrand was to place our global work—and the individual patient stories—at the center of how we speak about the organization. Looking back at our materials and outreach to date, we are confident that we have achieved this goal across every touch point of our communications.”</p>

<h3 class=""alt"">How to Do It</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.smiletrain.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Smile Train</a>, a New York-based international charity that provides corrective surgery for children with cleft lips and palates, is another nonprofit that recently rebranded—though not because it needed a name change. Founded in 1999 and approaching two major milestones—its 1 millionth cleft surgery and its 15-year anniversary—Smile Train wanted to update its branding and approach to ensure that its fundraising and engagement efforts were up-to-date. The charity was struggling to accurately communicate the nature of its work, and it needed a major overhaul of its messaging.</p>
<p>So the nonprofit set about reinventing itself. It examined the giving habits of current and prospective donors and interviewed its global staff and medical partners, using the findings to devise a rebrand strategy. “What followed was a complete brand refresh and fully integrated creative campaign that impacted every touchpoint of our communications, from the logo and look and feel of our brand, to the creative message, to the media channels we use to distribute content and the ways in which we seek to engage our audiences,” explained Susannah Schaefer, Smile Train’s CEO.</p>
<p>“Central to our brand refresh was our ‘Power of a Smile’ campaign—a departure from familiar direct response charity advertising that captures third world plight through the donor’s eyes,” she continued. “Instead, we sent an award-winning team of photographers and journalists far into developing countries to capture footage of Smile Train patients whose lives have been transformed by the cleft surgery they received from our local in-country medical partners. The campaign used a range of integrated multimedia tactics to tell the story of individual cleft patients through their own eyes, including videos, sharable infographics—or ‘SmileyGraphs’—and patient narratives.”</p>
<div id=""attachment_33252"" class=""wp-caption alignright"">
<p class=""wp-caption-text"">One of the “SmileyGraph” infographics described by Schaefer. Smile Train used the infographics as part of its new multimedia brand focus emphasizing visual storytelling.</p>
</div>
<p>Smile Train shifted the focus from the macro to the micro level, highlighting in its marketing materials individual patients and families. It employed interactive channels to better connect with supporters and updated its communications strategy to prioritize social engagement and visual storytelling. The SmileyGraphs campaign attained four times the average engagement rate for nonprofit posts on Twitter, and subsequent campaigns achieved similar levels of engagement.</p>
<p>“Since the rebrand, we’ve been better able to keep our donors steadily informed of our successes and provide context for how their contributions are changing the lives of patients and communities,” said Schaefer. “In addition, our experimentation with multimedia tactics, spanning video and crowdsourcing has been successful in raising awareness among new, younger audiences. Collectively, these efforts have driven greater, more substantive engagement with the organization, enabling us to cultivate deeper, longer-term relationships with our donor base.”</p>
<p>No two rebranding strategies will be the same—what worked for Smile Train won’t necessarily work for another nonprofit with different goals, needs and organizational makeup. But Smile Train’s example typifies perhaps the most critical element of a  rebrand, one that all nonprofits would be wise to prioritize in their rebranding efforts: building, or rebuilding, a connection with donors.</p>
<p>“What we usually encourage nonprofits to do is to shift the way they’re communicating away from an organization-centric voice—which is, ‘We do this, we do that, here’s why you should support us’—toward a voice that is audience-centric,” Durham said. “And we do that by trying to identify the mindset of people who might support the organization. So, what’s the mindset of our longtime donors? Why have they supported the organization? What do they think it’s about? Are they people who care about supporting scientific breakthroughs because it makes them feel a part of something cutting edge and meaningful?</p>
<p>“So it’s kind of a shift in strategy as opposed to just in tactics,” Durham added. “What we find is that a lot of organizations understand the tactics—they understand how direct mail works, even how email direct-response marketing can work—but oftentimes what they’re missing is the ability to send messages that really speak to that existing donor or prospect in a way that is audience-centric and reflective of why they care.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1","Nonprofit Pro creating your identity","","","nonprofit organizations brand reputation","branding brandraising rebrandeffect fundraising media guest","branding brandraising rebrandeffect fundraising media guest","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/aidanmorgan/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to John Morgan's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""35"">John Morgan</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

Personally, though, I’ve made peace with the fact that most EDs will ignore their own institutional messaging. Here’s why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executive Directors (or CEOs, if your nonprofit uses c-suite language) often come in two flavors: <i>fundraising</i> and <i>programs</i>. Executives with fundraising backgrounds are able to see and describe their organization’s work in donor-centric terms intuitively. They’ve learned how to listen for what’s interesting to an outsider and to shape stories that resonate with their audience’s values, interests, and personality. They inspire with tales of emotion and impact that make most people want to get out their checkbooks after they dry their wet eyes.</p>
<p>Executives of the programs variety are equally as effective, but the fire that burns within them is stoked by brilliant program design. Their eyes light up with passion as they engage in storytelling too, and soon their audiences want to meet the great staff or tour the programs themselves. Like experienced field guides, they do a great job inviting the outsider on a journey that starts with a problem and ends with results.</p>
<p>Most Executive Directors/CEOs I know have developed sophisticated skills when messaging about their organization. They’ve learned how to listen carefully and respond in audience-centric ways. They intuit how much information is enough, which stories or programs to highlight, and what the best call-to-action will be. It comes with practice; their years in the field have helped them build professional-level communications skills.</p>
<p>An Executive Director’s resistance to adopting organization-wide messaging is often directly related to the ease with which they employ this unique writing and speaking ability. After all, they’re great at messaging about the organization, so why get stuck with a more one-size-fits-all framework that’s less sophisticated than what they are already doing themselves?</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, staff people within most nonprofits are desperate for simple, clear, organization-wide messaging frameworks that will help them advance their communications skills. Programs staff, for instance, need help speaking or writing about other parts of the organization’s work beyond their own areas of expertise. Development staff want help articulating how everything ties together after that compelling success story is told. And just about everyone needs a clear call-to-action that helps suggest how the person they’re addressing can get more involved. In truth, even the communications experts on staff have less experience telling the nonprofit’s story than a typical ED has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executive Directors sometimes forget that their staff people are still learning how to speak and write effectively on behalf of the organization. Messaging helps staff people by creating scaffolding for writing and speaking they can rely on when things get scary or go beyond their area of expertise.</p>
<p>Staff people can forget that Executive Directors are experienced pros that are often entrepreneurial and adaptive people. It’s okay for them to bend the rules—as long as they aren’t describing a totally different animal.</p>
<p>Even when Executive Directors virtually ignore the messaging their colleagues have been creating, it still proves very useful, particularly for staff and board members who struggled to talk about the organization with confidence before. In fact, we recently surveyed clients we’d completed organizational messaging for over the past few years and found that most use their messaging on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So while I’ve made peace with the Executive Directors who ignore their organization’s messaging, I’ve also gotten increasingly convinced of the value of that same messaging for the staff people who are less expert at telling organizational stories.</p>

To continue our walk down DIY Design lane, let’s dive into typography and photoraphy.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">Refine and streamline your use of typography.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Typography is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate your personality, strengthen your identity, and tie all of your work together visually. Using type strategically and consistently will button up your brand and help build recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">The type you use should support your logo and never compete with it. Avoid highly-stylized, decorative fonts and instead choose a supplemental font that is clean, straightforward, and pairs well with your logo.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Keep it simple! Standardizing consistent use of one font across all materials will make your communications look clean, clear, well-organized, and branded. Try to choose one that has a large family with various weights and treatments (light, medium, bold, italics, etc) so that you have everything you need for hierarchy and emphasis.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Make sure it’s easy to read at large and small sizes. In order to use it consistently, the font needs to work equally well on a poster, business card, phone screen, computer screen, and any other material you might produce.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Don’t go rogue! Using numerous, inconsistent, and/or decorative fonts and embellishments can make materials appear sloppy and confusing. Eliminate variety and instead rely on using size, color, and weight to establish hierarchy in your text materials.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">Capture great photography that reflects the energy of your organization.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""/better_photos_on_a_budget"" target=""_blank"">Compelling photos are a powerful storytelling tool</a>, and can help you forge a strong connection with key audiences. For nonprofits, photos can do a lot to help supporters get a feel for what your work is all about, as well as the values that are important to you.</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Use photos that are simple and focus on one clear subject. Avoid busy backgrounds and lots of people.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Develop guidelines for using photos in your materials. Identify what kinds of images help tell the right kind of story about your nonprofit, and which to avoid. Provide these guidelines to photographers and team members to help them capture shots that will be useful to your team.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Whenever possible, get a photographer (the more experienced, the better) to capture a range of shots and contexts (e.g., some more informal, collaborative photos; some shots at special events and programs). There is a noticeable difference between well-lit, well-composed shots and those taken by amateurs. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">ONLY use hi-res imagery. These days even most cell-phones are taking hi-res pictures, so make sure your photography is up to present-day standard because blurry, dark, pixelated images will make your materials look dated and irrelevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">So there you have it—a quick, easy guide to smartening up your organization’s design.</p>

But before your organization starts dreaming too big, here’s a basic checklist you should run through.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Search for “employee brand ambassador” and you’ll find pages of articles hailing employees as the key to reaching new audiences, to developing an authentic, trusted voice, and to showing the world an inside view of the amazing work your organization is doing. Nokia, Adobe, and NPR are amongst some of the big names that have successfully tapped into the energy of their staff and, in the process, have driven revenue, bolstered recruitment efforts, and positively engaged new online communities. An employee brand ambassador campaign can sound like a dream come true for a nonprofit hoping to increase its online presence or grow its mailing lists on a shoe string budget. But before your organization starts dreaming too big, here’s a basic checklist you should run through before crafting recommended tweets for your employees.</p>
<p><strong>1. Establish goals first. </strong></p>
<p>Knowing what you’re hoping to accomplish will help direct your overall strategy and how you’ll message the program to your staff. Organizations should consider creating SMART goals to begin to develop a framework and timeline for measuring success.</p>
<p><strong>2. Assess what you have in place. </strong></p>
<p>Your employees should be building off of and contributing to what exists already, so as their followers gain interest in your organization, there is up-to-date engaging content that supports your goals. For example, if your organization is trying to cultivate new volunteers, make sure the volunteering section of your website is visible and polished.</p>
<p><strong>3. Know your voice. </strong></p>
<p>Employees should be encouraged to share content in a way that feels genuine to them, however, understanding the tone, look and online identity of your organization will help them assess what’s an appropriate post.</p>
<p><strong>4. Gauge employee morale. </strong></p>
<p>Employees need to be happy with the direction of your organization and the way that they are treated in order to become genuine brand ambassadors. Times of instability, low morale, or cultural shifts may be poor times to launch brand ambassador campaigns or trainings, particularly if your goals are externally oriented as opposed to using the campaign as a tool to improve employee engagement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Understand what it takes. </strong></p>
<p>Just like any social media effort, building brand ambassadors will take time, will require time, and likely encounter bumps in the road. Results will not happen overnight and it will require staff time to create social media policies and training as well as to monitor, maintain, and contribute to the program. There are also likely be mistakes along the way.</p>

<p>Here are some of the highlights of our discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most nonprofits see positive benefits of rebranding within two years. (<a href=""/rebrandeffect"">The Rebrand Effect</a>)</li>
<li>Branding shouldn't lead or precede a strategic plan. Branding should follow and articulate it.</li>
<li>Is your name out of sync with what you do nowadays? Whether you work in a different area or provide different services, having an outdated name can be a trigger for rebranding.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The key to a successful rebrand is not just launching a great new brand, but living and breathing it. If you're saying you're transformative, you should be transformative.</li>
<li>Ideally, your rebrand will put you in a position to make tangible &amp; emotional connections with your our supporters.</li>
<li>Rebranding not only makes you look good on the outside, but can help strengthen your organization on the inside. In fact, some argue that the #1 audience to prioritize in your nonprofit rebrand is staff. Involve your team from the beginning and make them proud to represent you.</li>
<li>Rebranding is an ongoing process. Launching your new name, logo, tagline, messages, or other significant changes is just the first step. Use every chance you have to communicate with your community as a chance to introduce or reinforce your brand strategy.</li>
<li>Rebranding is not a panacea. It won't fix internal communication problems, lack of budget/time, murky organizational structure, or fuzzy fundraising strategy.</li>

<p>Throughout the <a href=""http://givingdayplaybook.org/10lessons/"">research Knight Foundation has done on Giving Days</a>, one finding surfaces again and again: these online fundraising campaigns help the community foundations that organize them raise their own profiles, and increase awareness of the roles they play in their cities.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, many of the foundations don’t have a branding strategy in place to help them fully leverage the added boost of an attention-getting Giving Day.</p>
<p>Last week, Knight Foundation invited brand strategist Sarah Durham of Big Duck to provide tips on putting that kind of strategy in place, and implementing it in Giving Day campaigns. You can listen to the recording above, and read through a few key take-aways below from the presentation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Giving Day brands should connect to the community foundation’s overall brand:</strong> Most Giving Days operate off a separate brand, but ideally they should be part of the same branded family, Durham said. You can do this by having them share similar logos, fonts and colors. You can also connect with the name, as other non-profits have done. The March of Dimes, for example, now calls its walk-a-thons the “March to Help Babies” as a way to connect the brand to the event.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the community foundation’s brand by find ways to connect Giving Day participants to the foundation:</strong> “Often times in marketing, we tend to think about just getting people to show up. If we get enough people to show up, it’s successful,” Durham said. But organizers should be planning for ways to educate participants about the foundation behind the event. If there are in-person events, make sure a speaker can talk about the foundation, and provide a call to action. If it’s virtual, use the captured emails to follow up quickly with a communication that helps connect participants to the organizers.</li>
<li><strong>Your brand is more than your logo:</strong> In fact, your brand is everything that affects how the public perceives you. To get there, nonprofits need to look at both their positioning, or the big idea that makes you unique, and your personality, or the tone and style you want to be associated with. Positioning + personality = your branding strategy, Durham said. In the webinar, Durham provides more details on how to define your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t change your brand on a whim:</strong> “The only reason to change your brand is if there is evidence it doesn’t work,” Durham said. Nonprofits already have to struggle to cut through the clutter and be heard. You may need a refresh instead of a wholesale overhaul.</li>
</ol>

So many apple-picking excursions, flannel shirts, and pumpkin spiced lattes to look forward to. We've also been looking forward to seeing many of our clients with education-related missions kick off student recruitment season. To offer some inspiration for anyone trying to connect people with educational opportunities, we pulled together a few examples of recent campaigns we've had the chance to work on with some incredible education organizations. Take a peek.</p>
<ul>
<li>We helped create the brand for <a href=""http://www.educatorsrising.org"">Educators Rising</a>, an organization that launched in August to prime highschoolers for long, happy careers as teachers. We also asked Educators Rising's Co-Director Ashley Kincaid to pull back the curtain on how they&nbsp;<a href=""/getting-feedback-from-stakeholders-during-rebrand"">tested the brand along the way with their target audience—</a><a href=""/getting-feedback-from-stakeholders-during-rebrand"" target=""_blank"">check out that blog here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""/branding-to-boost-enrollment-at-art-school"">New York School of Interior Design</a> and <a href=""/math-for-america-teacher-recruitment"">Math for America</a>'s audiences may use different sides of their brains, but both organizations roll out recruitment campaigns to attract new students and fellows.&nbsp;Bonus: stay tuned for Math for America's new website!</li>
<li>What about education-related fundraising, you ask? We've got that covered, too. Big Duck worked with the 1:1 Fund to roll out a fundraising toolkit for their partners, empowering those partners to take the lead in soliciting donations. Learn about the 1:1 Fund, the process and results in&nbsp;<a href=""/economic-development-nonprofits-helps-partners-fundraise"">the new case study</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<p>The report identifies five donor segments—Contented Benefactors, Busy Idealists, Cautious Strivers, Unaware Potentials, and Unengaged Critics—and helps you understand what each group needs in order to be moved along a continuum of support. Camber claims that shifting or increasing their giving would unlock billions of new dollars for noprofits, and the report offers tools like behavioral segmentation to help you do so.</p>
<p>“Money for Good” highlights that donors are skeptical of nonprofits and overwhelmed by or frustrated with giving experiences. They manage these frustrations by maintaining loyalty to organizations they’ve previously supported and exhibiting preference for well-known nonprofits. This comes as no surprise to nonprofits who’ve consistently seen larger “name brand” organizations in their space eat their fundraising lunch, even when those orgs' work is less comprehensive or effective.</p>
<p>The report underscores the importance of communicating clearly, consistently, and with an eye towards building your organization’s visibility. Donors won’t stop giving to something familiar in favor of something they’ve never heard of, so as nonprofit brand-builders, we have to help them connect in meaningful ways and inspire them to shift their giving over time.</p>
<p>After you’ve read the report (<a href=""http://www.cambercollective.com/moneyforgood"" target=""_blank"">which you can download for free here</a>), consider using the behavior segmentation tools it provides to analyze your own list and apply the insights to your year-end appeal plans. Telling a more compelling, audience-centric story will help donors in each mindset connect more deeply.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","How to categorize your supporters","","","donor segmentation report","fundraising campaigns donors engagement","fundraising campaigns donors segmentation engagement yearend support","<p>Photo by <a data-rapid_p=""35"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/whatcouldgowrong/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to John Walker's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">John Walker</a><span class=""owner-name truncate""> (Flickr)</span><a data-rapid_p=""35"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/whatcouldgowrong/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to John Walker's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick""><br /></a></p>",

Last Wednesday we held our latest food challenge to test our refined palates. In previous challenges, we’ve compared everything from chocolate chip cookies to <a href=""/big-duck-blog-new-york-beer-food-challenge"">local beer</a>, and this time we decided to add a little spice.</p>
<p>The rules were simple: bring in a jar of salsa to be judged based on three important factors—taste, originality, and “je ne sais quoi”. After all the salsas were put into identical bowls to eliminate bias, the Ducks started dipping.</p>
<p>The homemade salsas were pitted against the store-bought, the savory against the spicy. Some Ducks appreciated the veggie-filled homemade salsas, while others spent their time debating whether or not Salsa Con Queso really qualified as salsa (either way, we ate the whole bowl of cheese dip). As the Ducks filled up on chips and dip, it became clear that the homemade salsas were fan favorites. That being said, store-bought held its own, with salsa from a Queens restaurant grabbing lots of Duck votes. In the end, it was Nickie's homemade mango salsa that took top prize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As The Salsa Challenge came to a close, our conversations turned away from salsa and to a heated debate about our next food challenge. There’s nothing we Ducks like talking about more than food, so what should our next challenge be? Pie? Cheese? Suggestions, anyone?</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1","Our spiciest food challenge yet","","","big duck salsa challenge","food-challenge fun bigduck","food-challenge fun bigduck dumbo brooklyn foodchallenge","",

He compiled some great advice -- full of recommendations, warnings, and good ideas that nonprofits of all sizes can benefit from. Here’s my take on #GivingTuesday (spoiler: I think you need to give it attention!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/"">#GivingTuesday</a> has grown in popularity, recognition, and success to a point where I don’t think nonprofits can afford to ignore it. The challenge lies in figuring out how to plug it into the rest of your communications, especially if you are implementing a year-end appeal or annual fund campaign at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style=""padding-left: 30px;"">
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Rather than create a separate #GivingTuesday campaign, I think most organizations should integrate it into their overall calendar or year-end campaign. If you are worried that it might take away from other efforts, consider testing a single channel ask–such as a 24-hour match promoted on Facebook or a selfie sharing campaign (giving voice over money) on Instagram.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style=""padding-left: 30px;"">
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If you are worried that asking for money on this day can hurt other efforts, ask for something else. Use #GivingTuesday to ask for time, passion, activism, and other efforts that might engage your donors beyond giving money.</p>

Maybe you feel that you already know your mission and what your programs do and it’s not worth the time and investment. Having seen the impact of key messages myself as a nonprofit staffer, I couldn’t disagree more.</p>","<p>At a fast-moving nonprofit, it can be tempting to shrug off key message development. Maybe it feels like you already know your mission and what your programs do and it’s not worth the time and investment.</p>
<p>Having seen the impact of key messages myself as a nonprofit staffer, I couldn’t disagree more. It’s actually one of the most important projects that a communications team can undertake. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p><strong>Oh, the time you’ll save </strong><br />With a set of key messages on hand that cover the basic points of the problem your organization confronts, what you are doing about it, and what you hope to achieve—all written in (get this) approved language, producing new materials no longer has to be a slog. Key message development takes care of the hard work of finding the right language up front, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time you need to write a new email. Just take the messages you need, organize them well and fill in the blanks with an engaging narrative.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, if you’re reading this you probably work at a nonprofit and you’re probably stretched to your limit trying to do what you can to end hunger, cure diseases, or stop climate change. Key messages can free up your time to focus on new ideas and be more strategic as you work to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>Makes brand maintenance a piece of cake</strong><br />Okay, we’re only talking about the written side of your brand, but that’s a lot, isn’t it? Your brand is more than just your mission statement and logo. It’s your personality (the feeling people get from your organization), positioning (the big idea you represent), values (the belief system that guides your approach), and, oh, so much more.</p>
<p>Key messages help by laying out the main facts that are essential to your organization’s story written with language that reflects a particular personality and other key elements of your brand. This way, by framing communications around key messages, a consistent tone will be present and messages that reflect your values will appear again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Lets you own hearts and minds</strong><br />How many touch points does it take to win a supporter? I know it used to be seven, but that was before we officially entered the worlds of Blade Runner and Minority Report.</p>
<p>If a single second delay in page load time can lead to a <a href=""https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/"">7% decrease in conversions</a>, your supporters are only going to give any single piece of communication so much time and mindspace. That means that if you want an idea to stick you need to put it out there again and again...and again and again. And the more consistently you state your primary messages, the faster they will become part of your recognized brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Insta-media ready</strong><br />When I went through media training, one of the most important things I learned was the importance of having central messages to fall back on. If you are asked a question that you’re not sure exactly how to (or just can’t) answer, the standard advice is to just fall back on a key message you know by heart that most closely relates to the question.</p>
<p>This tactic is why you may have been infuriated by politicians whose answers don’t truly address the question. But the alternative can end up looking like you caught <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jeb-bushs-foot-in-mouth-problem/2015/08/28/b87c780c-4d80-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html"">Jeb Bush’s foot-in-mouth disease</a>. So, put those key messages in your pocket if you need to, stick to the script, and make sure your nonprofit’s hard-won media coverage gives that warm glow you need to win supporters.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1409%2","Key messages matter","","","benefits of nonprofit messaging","brandraising messaging","brandraising messaging","<p>Photo by <a data-rapid_p=""35"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/dr/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to David R.'s photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">David R. </a><span class=""owner-name truncate"">(Flickr)</span><a data-rapid_p=""35"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/dr/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to David R.'s photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick""><br /></a></p>",

Why does the organization exist? What problems is it solving? Why should I support it? For many nonprofits, answering these questions feels hard to do succinctly; it’s much easier to tell a micro-story than the bigger, institutional one.</p>
<p>And that’s where brandraising comes in. Much of what we do during the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"">brandraising process</a> involves helping organizations find simpler, clearer, more powerful ways to communicate.</p>
<p>We've written at length about how <a target=""_blank"" href=""/benefits-of-nonprofit-messaging"">messaging</a> and your brand guide—two products of brandraising—are a huge part of making that work come to life after the branding process, but we still hear lots of people asking what that looks like. Recently, we were thrilled to see a perfect example of branding elements put into action by our client, The Center for NYC Neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Center’s mission is relatively straightforward—promoting and protecting affordable homeownership in New York—but with many different initiatives, programs, and partners that help homeowners all across the city (and, increasingly, the state, as well), it was tough to explain their work succinctly. After a stint working with Big Duck, they now tell their story exceptionally well – and in less time than it takes to brush your teeth.</p>
<p>Our work with the Center (or any organization, for that matter) was not a cosmetic process: we worked collaboratively to make sure that the Center’s new brand strategy, vision, mission, and values statements, messaging, and visuals all accurately projected the personality of the organization in order to help achieve its goals. At the end of the process, they had a comprehensive brand guide detailing their new messaging and visual framework that their staff, freelancers, and other agency partners could put to work practically.</p>
<p>And put it to work they have! Their website is updated with their new logo and look, and their staff are integrating the new messaging in all of their written and spoken communications.</p>
<p>The Center recently premiered a video about their work at their conference on “The Future of Affordable Homeownership in NYC,” which brought together several hundred of their partners who share the Center’s goal of keeping opportunities for homeownership within reach for middle- and working-class New York families. The video’s storyline boiled down their key messages to the essential information they wanted to communicate about their work. Working with a freelance animator,<b> </b>they developed a clip that was visually consistent with the brand. In less than two minutes, the video explains why their work is so important and inspires you to be a part of it. It’s clear, compelling, and very on-brand.</p>
<p>Best of all, scripting and producing the video wasn’t an onerous process, thanks to the key messages and design guidelines hammered out during the brandraising process. These are tools meant to set nonprofits up to create materials more easily—and the Center's video shows just how handy those tools really are when put to use by such a savvy staff and others.</p>

<p>Before Thanksgiving, before #GivingTuesday, and before December 31, there’s one critical day that you need to pay attention to as a nonprofit marketer or fundraiser.</p>
<p>And that day is&nbsp;<i>today</i>:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.networkforgood.com/resources/beyourdonor/"">Be Your Donor Day</a>!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Of course, every day can and&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be Be Your Donor Day, but today is the day we decree that you set aside some time today to look at your nonprofit’s marketing materials, fundraising experience, and online presence through the eyes of a donor.</p>
<p>Ready to get this party started?</p>
<p>Put on your donor hat and run through your organization’s website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find (and test) your nonprofit’s contact information or contact form</li>
<li>Call your phone numbers and test your phone tree (if applicable) and see if you reach a real person or hit a dead end</li>
<li>Make sure you can locate your donation page and easily click to make a donation</li>
<li>Subscribe to your email newsletter and find out what happens next</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, hit your donation page and get ready to give:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many fields do you need to fill out to complete your gift? How long does it take?</li>
<li>Is it easy to make a recurring gift?</li>
<li>What happens once you submit your donation? Are you prompted to share and learn more?</li>
<li>Do you immediately get a receipt? How long does it take to get a thank you for your donation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, whip out your smartphone and repeat all of the above—how does everything look and work?</p>
<p>Apply this same treatment to any donor-facing asset, online or off.</p>
<p>Be sure to run through these steps yourself, and then ask a few other staff members (or volunteers) do the same. Bonus points if you ask someone completely removed from your organization to help you celebrate Be Your Donor Day by bringing a totally objective and fresh eye to putting your processes to the test. You might be amazed at what you discover!</p>

<p>Want to take Be Your Donor Day one step further? Some of my favorite experts share how you can apply this donor-centric view to your communications approach:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In your thank-you communications, mention when your donor will hear from you next. If you are putting them on a newsletter list, say so! If you plan to send invitations to events in the near future, say so! You want to build an expectation of ongoing communications and that this is the start of a beautiful long-term relationship. – Kivi Leroux Miller,&nbsp;<a href=""http://nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog"">Nonprofit Marketing Guide</a></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Don’t just guess at what your donor wants or thinks…ask her! Send a survey, pick up the phone, pose a question over small talk at your next event.

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I tell people all the time to put themselves in their donor’s shoes and think about what’s interesting to the donor. Fundraisers have to stop talking about their organization, their programs, and their need to fund their budget, and instead talk about what donors care about: impact, outcomes, and how lives are being changed.&nbsp;<a href=""http://getfullyfunded.com/the-1-big-mistake-that-ruins-most-nonprofit-fundraising-appeal/"">Here’s an article that shows you how to do that in an appeal</a>. — Sandy Rees,&nbsp;<a href=""http://getfullyfunded.com/"">Get Fully Funded</a></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Make a gift to an organization that your donors also like to give to.

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Successful appeals are NOT about how wonderful your organization is. Successful appeals ARE about how wonderful the donor is.

Online giving in response to email is steadily increasing among all demographics, which means that it’s more important than ever that you nail your digital mailing game. But how exactly do you make your organization’s emails stand out from the crowd?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Big Duck has worked with nonprofits to draft many, many year-end emails—and we’ve produced lots of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/write-great-donor-emails"">blog posts</a> and webinars over the years detailing what we’ve learned along the way. To set you up for this season, we’ve taken a look back at some of the most useful tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Write with a sense of urgency.</strong> With all the emails flooding your donor’s inbox, make sure your message is an urgent one. Phrases like “give now” and “our project can’t wait” will drive donors to immediately take action. Something else to keep in mind: if you time your emails to correspond with specific events or milestones, they’ll have a built-in sense of timeliness and urgency.</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start=""2"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Include your call to action throughout.</strong> You should include more than just a donate button at the bottom of your email. Links to donate should appear early and often (think every third or fourth paragraph) so the donor is sure of the action to take. Repetition is your friend.</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start=""3"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Improve your subject lines (better yet, test them)!</strong> Every subject line should be specific, relevant, and urgent—and brief. To get a better sense of which subject lines your donors respond to, test a few different ones for open rate, click-through rate, and response rate.</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start=""4"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Make sure your email message answers these questions: </strong></p>
</li>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Why now? Let your donor know why year-end is a crucial time to give.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Why me? Persuade them to give to your organization by emphasizing the compelling work that your nonprofit does.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Will it help? Tell the donors that their money is going to an important cause.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">How much? Make it about the donor by showing them exactly what their gifts can do.</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>Of course, there’s more than just great writing involved in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/raise-money-and-appeal-to-donors-webinar"">a successful year-end fundraising campaign,</a> but clear, persuasive emails are a crucial part of driving donations.

<p>A campaign can help you reach a particular audience to take a specific action—and your brand can help!

Some nonprofits use campaigns to introduce their brand while others use it to shift or expand the perception of their organization.</p>

We know you’re pretty eager to start making those big asks, but before you do, you might want to check in with your supporters in a more<a href=""/moving-audience-up-your-ladder-of-engagement""> low-key way</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The average nonprofit sends <a href=""http://www.mrss.com/lab/2014-nonprofit-year-end-fundraising-in-review/"">7.5 fundraising emails</a> in December. Multiply that by the roughly four organizations your donor probably gives to, then add in e-newsletters, petitions, communications from organizations she is interested in but doesn’t yet give to—it can be easy for your ask to get lost in the mix.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So what can you do about it? The bottom line is that your constituents are the most engaged with your organization and cause right after they have taken action. Activists are <a href=""https://www.blackbaud.com/files/resources/downloads/WhitePaper_ConnectingOnlineAdvocacyAndFundraising.pdf"">seven times more likely to donate</a>, compared to supporters who haven’t taken action yet. If your supporters take some kind of action for your organization, it means they have taken the time to actively pay attention and send a signal that they care about your mission and your work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That’s why incorporating non-monetary actions into any fundraising campaign is worth some serious consideration, and when it comes to the year-end season, it should definitely be a priority.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Thanksgiving is a perfect time to make sure your supporters are engaged.</strong> That might mean asking them to sign a pledge or petition, take a quiz, or share a message on social media. Tying an easy engagement action into a Thanksgiving message is a great way to remind your supporters why your cause is important and why they care</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>By taking advantage of that quieter moment, you will prime your supporters to notice and respond to your emails in December.</strong> And this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t also consider mixing lighter asks or engagements like eCards with optional donation asks into your December calendar—but open rates tend to drop in December because of email volume, so you’ll get more bang for your buck (so to speak) out of a late November message.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Something else to keep in mind: remember that the question is, are your supporters engaged? </strong>If you regularly send advocacy emails or just ran an awareness campaign, your constituents may already be there. In that case, it may make more sense to send them a message just to give them some love. After all, <a href=""/ways-to-show-donors-you-appreciate-them"">it’s all about donor love</a>.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's now been a few months since the December deluge of nonprofit fundraising appeals, and it's around this time that I like to take a big-picture look at what we were seeing this past year-end season. W</span>hat stories were nonprofits telling? What language were they using? What clever new tactics were they trying?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Last year, one move stood out to me above all: the matching gift. While matching gifts have been used by fundraisers for a while, it appeared that more nonprofits than ever before were making them a part of their year-end fundraising efforts. A good portion of the direct mail pieces and emails that I opened in this past year-end cycle urged donors, “Give now and your gift will be doubled!” and promised them, “Your donation will be matched dollar for dollar if you give by December 31st!” Here at Big Duck, the majority of our campaigns clients used matching gifts to incentivize giving—from social service agencies to healthcare organizations to advocacy groups.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you’re not familiar with what matching gifts are, here’s the quick story. Put simply, a matching gift is a fundraising tactic. It’s a conditional commitment by a donor, either by an individual or an institutional funder like a corporation or a foundation, to match the contributions of others at a specific rate.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While matching gift programs were long used by companies to spur employee charitable giving (most major corporations have a matching gift program), now nonprofits are leveraging them to drive individual donor fundraising as well.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here are a few common types of matching gifts and how they work.</span></p>
<p><strong>The 1:1 match.</strong> A donors says she’ll match every gift raised, dollar for dollar, usually up to a certain amount or by a certain date. Say the matching donor gives up to $100,000 to your nonprofit by December 31st. If a gift is made for $100 before that date, the organization receives $200. Some donors will even commit to doing a 1:3 or 1:4 match. Heck, one of Big Duck’s clients this year did <em>two</em> time-bound 1:1 matches—a smaller one exclusively for Giving Tuesday and a larger one for their entire year-end efforts.</p>
<p><strong>The all or nothing matching gift.</strong> This one’s a bit intense. An individual or institutional donor commits to making a certain size gift to an organization, if and only if the same amount of money is raised by the organization in a designated time period. If the organization isn’t successful in raising the money, then they don’t receive the match. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>The “take-action” match.</strong> Some organizations will secure a matching donor to give every time a supporter takes a certain action, like taking a pledge, liking their Facebook page, or signing up for their email list. This year, one of our clients had a matching donor giving $1 every time a supporter tweeted a hashtag associated with an awareness raising campaign. It’s a win-win: grow your email list and fundraise at the same time!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So, what’s the magic behind the matching gift and why all the hype?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The numbers show that matching gifts really can encourage charitable giving. Nonprofits find that offering a match increases both the average gift and the response rate of a fundraising campaign. So why might that be?</span></p>
<p><strong>They’re a deal.</strong> Everyone is looking to get more bang from their buck, even donors. So when you present a potential supporter with an opportunity to have their gift doubled or tripled, you make them feel like the impact of their gift is increased and it’s a worthwhile investment. How can someone that cares about your mission pass that up?</p>
<p><strong>They’re motivating.</strong> Matching gifts are goal-oriented. When you tell your donors that you’re trying to raise a certain amount of money and the match will help you get there, it influences them to take action and join the effort.</p>
<p><strong>They’re urgent.</strong> A matching gift is a time-sensitive invitation to take action. They say to your donors that if you don’t give now, you might miss the special opportunity to have your gift doubled. And that’d be a shame!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You might be thinking, this all sounds fabulous but what’s the bad news? I think there are a couple things that you should be mindful of. &nbsp;First, it seems that the prevalence of matching gifts in the nonprofit world has been on the rise. While I think it’s too early to tell, it’s possible that the motivating effect they have on donors might eventually wear off with time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Secondly, before you reach for the phone to secure a matching donor, be sure to consider if it’s the right fit for your organization’s donors. After all, not every donor is created equal, and as a fundraiser, you know your donors best. Be sure you consider whether your existing or prospective supporters might be inspired to give because of a match. If you’re not sure, you may want to test it first, through a smaller campaign, before you roll it out in a big way around year-end.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If your organization hasn’t leveraged a matching gift to drive fundraising yet, I’d say consider it in your 2015 fundraising plans. It has been a tried-and-true tactic in the fundraising toolkit for good reason: it seems to work.</span>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","2015 year-end fundraising matching gifts","","","doubling gifts in holiday campaigns","fundraising campaigns yearend donors matching","fundraising campaigns yearend donors matching gifts holiday","",

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Show some emotion: </strong>Your donor is more likely to return if she feels a sincere connection to your organization. Make sure your thank you’s showcase your organization’s voice and personality, so that your donor remembers why she is so inspired by what you do.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Talk about next steps:</strong> Let your donor know when she is going to hear from you again, and give her a few ways to interact with your organization other than donating. Keeping your supporters involved shows how much you value long-term relationships with them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Send it shortly after a donation:</strong> The faster you send a thank you, the more sincere it’ll feel to the donor. After one or two days, your organization isn’t as fresh in her mind, so send a thank you note with next steps as soon as you can to keep them connected to your mission.</p>

When you’re going for “beautiful but confusing,” think James Joyce. When you’re going for “clear and motivating”—as most of us are when writing copy for communications materials—<em>Ulysses</em> probably shouldn’t be your inspiration. So what does good copy look like? Here are a few tips we Big Duck copywriters like to keep in mind when writing for our clients:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Outlines are your friend.</strong> There’s nothing more daunting (for a writer) than a blank page and a blinking cursor, so consider starting with an outline—particularly when writing longer pieces, like emails, direct mail letters, and web pages. Not only will you have tackled your first hurdle (going from empty page to rough sketch), you’ll be able to focus your writing more easily and craft your content more carefully.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Remove unnecessary adjectives—they can crowd your writing.</strong> I’m not arguing for entirely barebones writing. What I <em>am</em> arguing for is writing that guides the reader along rather than confuses her with unnecessary clutter. This is especially true for fundraising appeals—throwing in too many adjectives and adverbs will just distract the reader from what really matters: the ask!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>When you want to use the bigger word, use the smaller word.</strong> Sigh. The liberal arts school graduate in me sometimes misses the days of using the five-syllable synonym for a one-syllable word, but the copywriter in me knows that those big clunky words are just that: clunky. Impress your readers with the incredible work you’re doing—not your vocabulary.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, these rules aren’t hard and fast, but they can certainly help you clean up your copy and point you in the right direction. And remember: there’s no such thing as good writing, only good rewriting.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1416%1,1409%2","Tips for clear writing","","","nonprofit copywriting advice","copywriting writing ","copywriting writing creative copy tips","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/nirufe/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Niklas  Freidwall's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""36"">Niklas Freidwall</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Multimedia use:</strong> Animated GIFs everywhere!

I know, this is your busiest time. Most fundraisers and communicators are fretting over email appeals and boosted social media posts, anxiously hitting refresh on their donation processing systems and looking for reply envelopes from direct mail letters.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We push because we know these are the weeks that tend to attract the most dollars coming in from individual grassroots supporters. But I want to invite you to take a break. For just a few minutes, pause and think about the future with me.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"" dir=""ltr"">How will you communicate with your donors differently in 2016?</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you want to raise more money next year, you MUST start by answering this question. How you talk to, write to, speak to, and track your donors is the key to getting donors to give again--and give more. It’s true, to be successful in fundraising, you need good communications.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"" dir=""ltr"">First, pledge to celebrate your donors and make them feel like heroes.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your messages should feature <a target=""_blank"" href=""/raise-money-and-appeal-to-donors-webinar"">highlights of your accomplishments as your donor’s victories</a>. And rather than send one appeal after another, you should be mixing in messages of progress and results and giving them <a target=""_blank"" href=""/engage-donors-before-asking"">lots of things to do</a> beyond giving you their credit card information or access to their PayPal account. And if you are really putting donors’ needs first, you should be asking them why they give and how they want to hear from you. Do you know? Are you using that information to tailor your approach?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"" dir=""ltr"">Next, tear down those silos and get ready to dig in.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your messages should sound like they come from one organization that seems like it values a donor and needs her to help achieve your essential mission. Unfortunately, I see lots of examples of messages that focus purely on transactions—attend our event, read our report, give us money—with no connection to a bigger story. And what’s worse, I either get bombarded one week with overlapping requests or go weeks or months without hearing a word.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even though your team may be divided by department or function, your communication with donors should be unified. Are you creating a plan that everyone contributes and agrees to? Do you share a universal calendar so messages are coordinating and make sense as part of your overall story and brand? Should you meet with your colleagues more regularly to make sure everyone is on the same page?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"" dir=""ltr"">Finally, find more time to solidify or revise your donor communications plans.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Take 30 more seconds to look at your calendar in January. Find one day that looks meeting-free and block out the entire day to audit your past donor communications, look at your systems for capturing and sending information, analyze your results, and start mapping out what a better year of communications might look like. Already have a plan? Take that time to review it again and see how it can be better.</p>
<p>Need more help? <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fundraising-plan-bootcamp"">Join me and small group of other nonprofiteers in a two-day immersive workshop on this topic</a> in January. Beyond the class, we’ll also have two coaching calls to help you strengthen your approach.</p>
<p>I hope to see you in that workshop--or another one soon. And with less than three weeks until the end of the year, may the dollars and the support come rolling in.</p>","","","a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:4:{s:2:""on"";s:2:""on"";s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:16:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:20900;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:21091;s:0:"""";i:21128;s:0:"""";i:21554;s:0:"""";i:22075;s:1:""1"";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:20:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:21063;s:0:"""";i:21143;s:0:"""";i:21446;s:0:"""";i:21532;s:0:"""";i:21681;s:0:"""";i:21563;s:0:"""";i:21682;s:0:"""";i:21938;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","Planning your donor communications","","","plan for engaging supporters 2016","fundraising donors engagement plan internal","","<p>Photo by <a data-rapid_p=""60"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kittysfotos/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Kitty Terwolbeck's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"">Kitty Terwolbeck </a><span class=""owner-name truncate"">(Flickr)</span><a data-rapid_p=""60"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/kittysfotos/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Kitty Terwolbeck's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick""><br /></a></p>",

<p>More <a href=""http://www.fundraising.co.uk/2015/06/01/the-sickening-spectacle-surrounding-the-death-of-olive-cooke/"" target=""_blank"">substantive and credible voices</a> countered that the “begging letters” Ms. Cooke received had come from organizations that had maintained high standards in their fundraising, and that her death was not the result of being pursued by nonprofits. Nonetheless, the incident whipped up a frenzy of scrutiny of nonprofit solicitation practices in the UK. Over the summer, articles from <i>Third Sector</i>, the <i>Nonprofit Quarterly</i>, and other credible industry resources noted that if nonprofits don’t take responsibility for monitoring their own practices effectively, the government may step in and do so, likely with a more restrictive hand.</p>
<p>Nonprofits work hard to build relationships with donors, often in multiple channels. Today’s donor might hear from your organization through social media, email, snail mail, telesolicitation, video, and more. Soon, they might even tour your programs in <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/virtual-reality-could-be-next-big-thing-charitable-giving-180955830/?no-ist"" target=""_blank"">virtual reality</a>. It can feel overwhelming for the people receiving all of those messages, not to mention the nonprofit staff people trying to walk the line between cutting through the clutter, communicating clearly, and potentially overcommunicating.</p>
<p>So how much is too much? When are you going to far? Farra Trompeter recently wrote a thoughtful piece on how to tear down silos, make your donor feel like a hero, and <a href=""/plan-for-engaging-supporters-2016"" target=""_blank"">map your donor communications in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>But let’s face it: the future of your donor communications is really in <em>their</em> hands, not yours. After all, the technology that allows donors to dictate their preferences for communications—defining exactly how often and what you can send them—is getting more affordable and increasingly expected.</p>
<p>Blackbaud recently invited a small group of senior fundraisers from America’s largest nonprofits to a forward-looking conference called NPNext. And if there was one theme that permeated the day, it was <i>donor control</i>.</p>
<p>Steve MacLaughlin, Blackbaud’s Director of Analytics, predicted that, in time, your CIO (chief information officer) and your CMO (chief marketing officer) will evolve into a CXO: Chief Experience Officer. Steve sees technology becoming so plug-and-play that we won’t need people who specialize in data or technology to translate it for the rest of us. The data mining and segmenting you want will help you develop the customized content your audiences increasingly expect much more seamlessly, and this will become the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>Here’s one example of how I imagine this should work in the near future.</p>
<p>When people register for an event, sign up for a newsletter, or take any other action with your nonprofit, they will be dropped automatically into streams of communications defined by their preferences and past actions. If, as a supporter of the National Brain Tumor Society, I demonstrate my interest is primarily on Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the bulk of communications I receive might focus on GBM-related research, advocacy, and discoveries.</p>
<p>If I also participate in a New York area walk, I might also get information about local events or walks, probably not those taking place in California. The calendar of communications I receive will not only reflect my behaviors and interests, it will adapt as I take further action.</p>
<p>Watched a video? Great! I’ll get more videos and less to read downstream, perhaps. Ignored the past few advocacy alerts? Perhaps the volume of actions I’m asked to take will be adjusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many nonprofits send new donors and prospects a series of emails (usually called a “welcome series”), although I’ve seen few orgs do much more than deliver a string of generic “thanks for joining us” messages. I’m talking about something much more personalized: messages that are customized with content selected automatically based on your behavior. Depending on what you’re viewing online, clicking on, or participating in, the technology notices and adjusts accordingly.&nbsp; Content gets ever more customized, and therefor more attention-worthy.</p>
<p>These personalized streams of donor communications are called “drips” by marketing automation fans (ok, nerds) like us Ducks. We design them for ourselves and our clients the way you’d design a flow chart, flowing people through a set of if/then options designed to engage them in ways that <i>feel</i> personalized—but might not actually require much personalized touch.</p>
<p>Still, for most organizations, that future is hard to imagine. The technology isn’t yet so plug-and-play: it takes a sophisticated mix of staff, consultants, and technology to build a communications stream that engages donors in segmented, personalized, meaningful ways.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about how to up your nonprofit’s game in 2016 and feel ready to take a step forward (without totally jumping in to the deep end of the pool), Big Duck’s fabulous Farra is leading a two-day deep-dive immersive workshop (with some additional support afterwards) in January on <a href=""/fundraising-plan-bootcamp"" target=""_blank"">developing a donor communications plan</a> so you can nail down your communications program for 2016 like a rock star.</p>
<p>Over the next few years (maybe even months) the way we all communicate will continue to change in ways we might not even imagine today. Think of the possibilities! So here’s to a future of virtual reality, 3D videos, and—most of all—smarter, better fundraising.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1,2059%2,2061%3,1067%4","Engaging donors in 2016","","","future of personalized communications","donors engagement messaging technology","donors engagement messaging technology future tech tools","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/x-ray_delta_one/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to James Vaughan's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""61"">James Vaughan</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>",

Too often, these meetings feel endless, dull, and unproductive.</p>
<p>I’ve been put to sleep and moved to tears in board meetings. You’ve been there too, right?</p>","<p>For many, the words “board meeting” ignite a burning sensation in the gut or the onset of a cold sweat. Too often, these meetings feel endless, dull, and unproductive.</p>
<p>I’ve been put to sleep and moved to tears in board meetings. You’ve been there too, right?</p>
<p>So with the release of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/"">a new Star Wars film</a> I started thinking about how some people seem to be Jedi Knights in board meetings, while others present with all the goodwill and utter unintellibability of a Wookie.</p>
<p>Want to be a Jedi Knight? Here are few tips I’ve learned observing some real pros in action:</p>
<p><b>1. Make the board members the hero of your presentation.</b> Don’t just stand in the front of the room projecting endless slides and talking at them. Remember, Yoda is powerful because he facilitates the inner hero in Luke Skywalker and other Padawan learners he trains.&nbsp; If you’re presenting to the board it’s because you need them to understand, buy in, or approve something. Help them do that by giving them an exercise or facilitating a meaningful discussion on your content. Spend less time talking at them and more time getting them to do the talking so they truly take ownership of the work.<br /><b></b></p>
<p><b>2. Create lasting memories.</b> Jedis like Obi-Wan Kenobi regularly appear posthumously to remind the hero why they’re fighting the good fight. You can do the same for your board members by tying the content of your presentation back to the mission in memorable ways. Tell stories, share videos, and use metaphors to inspire emotional responses, not just intellectual ones.</p>
<p>One CEO framed a discussion of the organization’s future around a funny mountain climbing theme. He clumsily retouched staff and board member’s faces onto real photos of people climbing—and then summitting—Mount Everest.&nbsp; He wove the metaphor throughout his presentation using maps and other climbing references. I may not recall every detail of his presentation months later, but the key ideas have stuck with me through his skillful and engaging presentation approach.</p>
<p><b>3. Observe—and use—the Force.</b> Too often, people who present at board meetings drone on instead of reading the dynamics in the room and adjusting accordingly. Is someone conducting a side conversation? Checking the email? Dozing off? These are signs you’ve lost their attention. Instead of just ignoring them and barrelling ahead, consider preparing a few ways you can comfortably re-focus and re-engage people in advance.</p>
<p>Asking questions that require a show of hands followed by discussion is one simple way to do it. For example, you might ask, “How many of you feel that reducing this budget item next year makes sense? How many disagree? Does anyone want to comment?”</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to shift attention to another voice; show a video that illustrates your point (ideally with humor) or ask the programs officer in the room to stand up and share their perspective. Consider your role to curate or orchestrate the conversation, not dominate it.</p>
<p>Do you have examples of Jedi Knight-worthy board presentations? I’m always interested in hearing what people do that works. Please share your stories in the comments. And may the Force be with you!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here’s a quick explanation: Developed by the British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, the law states that the amount of time someone takes to make a decision is directly proportional to the number of options they are presented with. There’s even a fancy </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law#Law"" target=""_blank""><span>equation</span></a><span> that includes logarithms and scary greek symbols.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In case you need more proof (or just enjoy nerding out), the law was most famously shown in action with an experiment involving two supermarket jam displays—one with six, the other with 24 mouth-watering options. More people took notice of the larger display, with 60% as opposed to 40% of customers stopping for a taste. But whereas 3% of the samplers actually bought jam from the larger display, the six-option display produced a 30% conversion rate.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What exactly was happening at the larger display? It clearly did a good job of attracting interest, so why didn’t that interest result in action? It’s called (just when you thought the nerdiness was over) </span><a href=""http://billyshall.com/blog/post/analysis-paralysis"" target=""_blank""><span>analysis paralysis</span></a><span>. Basically, overwhelmed by desire to make the best decision possible, people shut down and decide to pass.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And now we turn to the fast-paced, cluttered world of your supporter’s online experience. Email inboxes and social media feeds alone offer enough options to paralyze a time-strapped supporter. If you succeed in inspiring someone to move their eyeballs to your social post, click to open your email, Google your organization, or even (hope of hopes) type your URL directly into their browser, every second from that point on is important.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the experiment described above, we were talking about people with an entire supermarket trip—ten minutes at least—to think about which delicious jam deserves a coveted space in their refrigerator door.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Likely you’re not offering even six options for taking action in a single email or web page, but when 55% of internet users spend </span><a href=""http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj""><span>fewer than 15 seconds</span></a><span> on any website, even one additional option can have an effect on your conversion rates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In conclusion: be mindful of how much information and options you're throwing at your audiences—give them too much and they'll freeze!</span></span></p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1,2063%2,2061%3","Too many choices lower conversion rate","","","avoid overwhelming donors with choice","collateral fundraising online ","collateral fundraising online website choice donors","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/beginasyouare/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Mike_tn's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""30"">Mike_tn</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p>OK, online fundraisers, nap time is OVER!</p>
<p>The December fundraising season has come and gone. Some of you may still be crunching the numbers. Others may be on to the next campaign.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s time to talk results.&nbsp;<em>What worked? What didn’t? What did we learn, and how will we apply it to future campaigns?</em></p>
<p>I asked a few in-the-trenches practitioners — from nonprofits large and small — to share reflections on their December online fundraising campaigns. I work with both large and small nonprofits, and what I’m finding is that smaller nonprofits are still finding value in now-mainstay tactics like matches, resends, lightboxes and multiple sends on Dec. 31, while larger nonprofits that already applied these tactics are looking to boost results with mobile (from text messaging to mobile-optimized emails and landing pages), online&nbsp;advertising, sophisticated segmentation and advertising…and of course urgent, stellar, donor-centric storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s learn together.&nbsp;Share your reflections — the good, the bad and the ugly — in the comments section.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>One of our clients,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fountainhouse.org/"">Fountain House</a>&nbsp;(a nonprofit dedicated to the recovery of men and women with mental illness), had tremendous success with its&nbsp;<a href=""http://givingtuesday.org/"">#GivingTuesday</a>&nbsp;appeal and, later in the month, using a lightbox on its site.</p>
<p>For #GivingTuesday, we offered a 24-hour triple match and the email appeal sent out that day generated almost as many gifts as the one that was sent at the end of the year. And compared to 2014, Fountain House raised six times more money on #GivingTuesday in 2015 and almost doubled the average gift from $146.73 to $284.21!</p>
<p>The lightbox used an interactive form that greeted visitors to the organization’s website for the last two weeks of December. The design and copy on the form matched the rest of the campaign — direct mail letter, email series, social media posts, etc. — and we made sure that whatever amount the user selected, appeared on the donation page. In total, the lightbox attracted over 100 donations.</p>

<p>The money we raised during #GivingTuesday was an integral part of our year-end fundraising. Dollar and participation goals aside, we wanted to increase the gift size of some of our engaged, though not yet leadership-level donors. To do this – and to promote #GivingTuesday – we set up a match.</p>
<p>However, we decided not to seek one donor to offer a large gift amount. Instead, we reached out to five donors, each increasing their gift by $50 to $100. As each donor only had to increase their gift by a smaller amount, they felt much more comfortable doing so.</p>
<p>This strategy was a success in 4 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We had five recognizable names and a promise of a match to use in all our #GivingTuesday promotions.</li>
<li>These five donors gave in December as opposed to May and June.</li>
<li>We increased the gift amounts of five donors. In the future, we can solicit these donors at a higher level</li>
<li>We raised over $38,000 in one day, surpassing our original goal by 600%</li>

<p>We participated in Giving Tuesday for the first time this year. I’m a one-man band so I kept it simple and followed what we’ve done for other multi-channel campaigns – an email, several social posts and a good campaign donation landing page.</p>
<p>I did experiment with&nbsp;<a href=""https://goodworld.me/"">GoodWorld</a>, which lets people donate by using a hashtag. Once you register with GoodWorld, it monitors your Facebook page and Twitter feeds for mentions of the hashtag #donate20, which would then trigger a donation from the person for $20 (donors can donate any amount, so #donate50 would be a donation of $50).</p>
<p>We got a number of small gifts from GoodWorld through Facebook, which is where our audience is more active. I replied to each and every #donate comment to say thanks and express our gratitude. In keeping with our unique #GivingMoosDay theme, I used Facebook stickers of animated cows saying thanks.</p>
<p>The bulk of the online donations still were triggered by the email that we sent in the morning with a match offer.</p>
<p>Our Giving Tuesday goal was to raise $5k, but I saw that we’d surpass it early and raised it later in the day to $10k. We ended up raising $11k, plus the match.</p>
<p>One thing I’d try next year is a resend of the morning email with a lift note, and perhaps tying Giving Tuesday into a big, day-of volunteer project at the Sanctuary. I might also use Goodworld for an emergency rescue, where there is a real sense of urgency.</p>

<p>Working with Olga Woltman, Senior Director of Digital Fundraising at the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.diabetes.org/"">American Diabetes Association</a>, Beaconfire RedEngine begun testing new donation forms in the months leading up to year-end, with the goal of increasing the conversion and revenue per visitor. The test was very successful, validating the theory that streamlining the user experience by keeping them on a single page, particularly if a visitor is on a mobile device, would likely increase conversion rate and revenue per visit. Among the one-time donors, the test version increased the number of gifts by 69% and the conversion rate by 79% (from 11.56% to 20.74%) with a 96% confidence interval.</p>
<p>They used this winning form to add a twist to the usual EOY lightbox strategy. For the final two days of the year, a full-page donation form homepage takeover (featuring a newly announced ’48 hour flash match’), was implemented. Behavioral lightboxes — appearing at the top of pages, as full modal lightboxes, and on exit — also continued on other pages of the site.</p>
<p>Altogether, these strategies increased revenue by 33% from the previous year. It was a nice win bringing in vital revenue to get closer to curing diabetes and improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes.</p>

<p>(Reposted with permission.&nbsp;<a href=""http://seachangestrategies.com/batten-down-the-hatches/"">Here’s the original.</a>)</p>
<p>Politics has broken the Internet.</p>
<p>To be more specific, political fundraising has inflicted serious damage on email fundraising.</p>
<p>We on the progressive side have withstood the monthly and quarterly torrents of unabashedly beseeching emails from the DCCC, the DSCC, OFA, etc. With over-wrought subject lines like “I’m begging!” and “We’re desperate!” these emails have broken all rules of politeness, donor-centrism or anything else one might find in the boy or girl scout manual.</p>
<p>And they also raise buckets of cash.</p>
<p>The effect on the rest of us has been clear. To raise money in this environment, you need to step up your email cadence and up the ante to just stay even in terms of “share of inbox.” That’s fancy talk meaning we need to send a lot more emails with better offers to raise the same amount of money.</p>
<p>We’re seeing a dramatic rise in frequency across the board among most nonprofits. It wasn’t that long ago that no one would think to send three or four emails to their list on December 31st, but now it’s SOP. This year, the EOY scrum spawned an even newer phenomenon: 2-to-1 and even 3-to-1 matches. A year or two ago we told clients an end of year dollar-for-dollar match was “the price of entry” for end of year. Now it’ll barely get you into the bleachers.</p>
<p>With the Presidential insanity officially under way, this is going to be a bad year for online fundraising, especially for bringing on new donors. You will be competing with massive political fundraising machines who have huge email teams, test hourly and have absolutely zero interest in relationship-building. Good luck sending an appeal at the end of an FEC fundraising quarter.</p>
<p>What to do? Gather up your best donors. Focus in on repeat givers, sustainers, the mid-level donors, and other true-believers. Think of three new ways to absolutely delight them. Do it. Shield them as much as possible from the email arms race you will inevitably find yourself caught up in.</p>
<p>If you’re not in AA, drink heavily.</p>
<p>The line between email fundraising and panhandling has never been finer. Time to decide which side you wanna be on.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>When it comes to branding, it’s easy to get caught up in building your identity—</span><a href=""/renaming-your-organization"" target=""_blank""><span>the debates over your new name</span></a><span> or logo, the fine-tuning of your color palette, the wordsmithing over your mission statement and elevator pitch, and the back and forth over your shiny new website. But while the creation of your brand is both exciting and intense, keeping it consistent and relevant over time can be just as essential to your reputation. Just like it is important to check on your own health every year, so is too is the need for a periodic brand audit or check-up.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Big Duck conducts several brand check-ups every year</span><span>—</span><span>both for organizations we’ve developed brands for and for some we have not (we would be happy to tell you all about it</span><span>—</span><a href=""/contact"" target=""_blank""><span>just drop us a line here</span></a><span>)</span><span>. If you think this is something you might want to try in-house,</span><span> here is a four-step process you can follow to check on the health of your nonprofit’s brand.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>1. Book an appointment. </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Start by carving out time to focus on this review. Begin by blocking out a morning or afternoon and commit to tuning out the usual distractions of emails, social media, calls, and other meetings. Invite a few of your colleagues from different teams or departments to participate on a brand review committee. Getting diverse perspectives, especially from those that know different members of your community (e.g. donors, volunteers, program participants, funders, activists, etc.), will help you better understand how your organization is communicating with others. Be sure to invite not just the most senior members of the team, but also the ones who interact most frequently with your community. If you have any board members that are connected to specific groups of constituents and/or have communications expertise, consider inviting them, too.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2. Take the pulse of where you are.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Now it is time to revisit your brand strategy and see if it still matches your organization's strategy and communications. Most nonprofit organizations develop strategic plans every three to five years and/or create annual work plans. Does the explanation of your organization’s purpose, vision, and activities line up with the written, spoken, and visual explanation of who you say you are? And how closely aligned are elements like your mission and values with the thoughts and feelings evoked by your logo or “about us” boilerplate copy? Use your desired positioning (the big idea you hope others might associate with your organization) and personality (the tone and feelings you hope others would use to describe you) as a barometer. If you’ve developed these tools in a recent branding process, use them to review recent publications, your website, your appeals, etc. If you have not developed a brand strategy yet, facilitate exercises with your brand review committee to hone in on what you hope your reputation could be—keeping one foot in ideas that you might authentically be able to own and the other in ideas that are more aspirational. Assuming your brand strategy still feels relevant, look at the messages and visuals you are using in your communications, ask staff members to recite how they explain your organization, and push to see if you are being as clear and consistent as possible. </span><a href=""/brand_check_up"" target=""_blank""><span>Here’s a look at a similar process Sarah Durham led for the National Brain Tumor Society several years ago</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>3. Ask for a second opinion.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Just like many people will recommend you question an initial diagnosis from your doctor, getting the opinion of others is a crucial step as you review the health of your brand. Here is where you want to test internal perceptions against external ones. Consider conducting a few phone interviews, an online survey, or a focus group among people who know you. You might also reach out to a few people who don’t know you but should. Use these conversations or questions to learn how others see you and who they say you are. You might also benefit from asking colleagues at similar organizations how they define your organization in relation to who they are and your overall field. It may feel awkward to do this, but trust me</span><span>—</span><span>your peers, donors, current or future staff, board members, and others are asking those organizations how you compare, too, and hearing what they say can be hugely helpful in understanding how well you are (or are not) in tune with your desired positioning and personality. These exchanges with your community and your peers is also a great moment to ask or test how compelling or engaging you are. It’s no longer enough for people to understand </span><span>what</span><span> you are about</span><span>—</span><span>they need to also understand and connect to the </span><span>why</span><span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>4. Diagnose and prescribe: retrain, refresh or rebrand.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Time to gather your brand review committee, determine how healthy your brand is, and recommend a next step. We typically see three outcomes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You are fit as a fiddle</em><span><em>.</em> How you communicate on the outside still seems to match who you are on the inside. Your desired perception is generally in line with your reputation. Congratulations! As you enjoy a moment of pride, make sure to also keep up the great work. Keep your brand alive through regular trainings at staff meetings, periodic reviews of your style guide, and ongoing application of your brand strategy as a decision-making tool for your communications.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You could be doing better</em><span><em>.</em> The way others see you is only somewhat aligned with who you are. Take a deep breath and hone in on what parts of your brand or communications are not working and give them a tune-up. Maybe your core identity (name, tagline, and logo) still ring true, but your messaging is off. Or perhaps your approach to using images tells the story of who you used to be and not who you are now. Figure out what may be broken and give it a refresh.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><em>You are unhealthy and need help, stat!</em><span> Those who know you well get it, but there is confusion among members of your community or peers. And those who don’t know you but should, have a hard time understanding what you are all about. It can be difficult to admit that your communications are not doing all they can to advance your mission, raise money, increase visibility, and create change. Fret not, we are here for you! First, double-check your assumption that </span><a href=""/consider-timing-when-branding"" target=""_blank""><span>it might be time for a rebrand with this handy decision-making tool</span></a><span>. Then get buy-in from your colleagues and </span><a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-reasons"" target=""_blank""><span>make the case for rebranding</span></a><span>. Once everyone agrees, consider bringing in an outside consultant, agency, or volunteer to lead a rebranding process and support your efforts to make significant changes to your brand and communications.&nbsp;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-0b2fdb93-e190-fd56-8175-74135fdbf2b2""><span>If you are wondering how we might help give your brand a checkup or rebrand your nonprofit, just drop a note to </span><a href=""mailto:hello@bigducknyc.com""><span>hello@bigducknyc.com</span></a><span> and we’ll be happy to chat.</span></span></span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Before we dig in, the usual caveat—we’re not telling you to blast these words out of your dictionaries permanently. You might disagree with us, or you might really feel that there’s no better word choice in a certain situation. And that’s fine! We’re not the Word Police (would that be a funny or bad Halloween costume?). We just feel that, with a little effort, we can all find stronger, more appropriate, and less expected words than the ones below.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Big thanks to my lovely colleagues for feverishly emailing and IM-ing suggestions of words to avoid.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span>Passionate</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This one’s tricky because, in theory, we’re actually okay with the word </span><em>passionate</em><span>. But in the nonprofit world, every organization is passionate, every Executive Director is passionate, every celebrity spokesperson is passionate. What are we really trying to say? Your organization has a committed track record, your Executive Director is an expert, your spokesperson was moved to take action because of XYZ? </span><em>Passionate</em><span> shouldn’t be a catchall word.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You know who else is passionate? Fabio. Think about <em>that</em>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span>Viral</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">We included <em>viral</em> in <a href=""/big-duck-blog-language-your-nonprofit-should-not-use"" target=""_blank"">this post a couple years back</a>, but it just won’t go away (hm, really makes you think, doesn’t it?) One of the biggest problems with this word is that it essentially means nothing until after the fact. You can’t magically create a ""viral video""—you can create a video overflowing with Basset Hound puppies and Jennifer Lawrence, but there’s no guarantee it will do what you want it to do. And if it does—congrats, everyone already knows about it, you don’t need to tell them it’s a viral video.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span>Charity</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As you’ve probably noticed, Big Duck prefers </span><em>nonprofit</em><span> or </span><em>organization</em><span> over </span><em>charity</em><span>. There’s a reason for that. </span><em>Charity</em><span> is so Victorian, so </span><span><em>Oliver Twist</em>, </span><span>so “here-we-are-to-save-the-day.” We know that’s not how most of you think of the work you do, so why invite others to see you that way?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Think about it this way: Have you ever met anyone who actually wants to </span><span>receive</span><span> charity? It’s associated with an imbalance of power—with a certain level of helplessness—and it feels patronizing. Next.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span>Robust</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Maybe this is unfair, but too many of us just don’t like the way this word sounds. It feels stuffy, stodgy, antiquated, buttoned-up, and boring. And yet we see it everywhere! Sigh.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><span>At Risk</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This term rubs us the wrong way for much of the same reasons </span><em>charity</em><span> does. </span><a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/04/28/399949478/delinquent-dropout-at-risk-whats-in-a-name"" target=""_blank""><span>As NPR points out</span></a><span>, being at risk implies a need to be saved from said risk—plus, it’s infuriatingly vague and rather indirect. It can create the impression that you’re avoiding getting specific on purpose, and that’s certainly not what you want your audience to think, right?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As labels go, </span><em>at risk</em><span> might not be the worst (thank goddess we’re no longer using </span><em>delinquent</em><span>), but that doesn’t mean it’s the best.</span></p>

<p>As I explored this critical issue in my new book, <a href=""http://amzn.to/1M1DGhI"" target=""_blank""><i>Nonprofit Fundraising 101</i></a>, I interviewed Roderick Campbell, the CEO of nonprofit fundraising platform <a href=""http://www.commitchange.com"">CommitChange</a>. He shared a few takeaways from their efforts to maximize digital donations for <a href=""http://mercyhouse.net/"">Mercy House</a>, a $3.8M nonprofit that has provided housing and support to California’s homeless since 1989.</p>
<p><b><i>This simple formula helped Mercy House double online giving in just six months</i></b>, and I believe it can do the same for your nonprofit, too:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<b>Break it Down:</b> CommitChange helped Mercy House break the donation process down into four steps: recurring versus one-time; amount; info; and payment. Instead of asking for the information all at once, they simplified the process, which is especially helpful for digital donors contributing on their mobile device. Another great example of what this looks like is <a href=""https://donate.charitywater.org/dual/monthly_for_split/general_for_split"">charity: water</a>, also profiled in the book.</p>
<p>Whatever your process, be sure to <b><i>look closely at recurring giving</i></b>, as this creates valuable ongoing funding for your cause, increases gifts since people are more likely to donate $10 a month versus $120 now, and simple tweaking here can yield tremendous results: by leading with the recurring gift option, Mercy House increased the number of donors signing up as sustaining members by 400%!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<b>Stay Consistent: </b>The data proves what we all know in our guts:<b> <i>nobody likes to feel like they’re leaving your website once they hit that donate button</i></b>. So be sure to keep the look and feel of your donate page consistent with your website and other communication materials and ensure your logo remains visible throughout the giving experience. This simple change helped Mercy House convert more of the people who clicked “donate” to actual supporters, while simultaneously increasing average gift size.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<b>Streamline Donations: </b>Less is more, and once someone clicks “donate,” your job is to make the giving process as simple as possible. In fact, CommitChange discovered that <b><i>every field eliminated from the donation experience increases conversion by 2%</i></b>. They further optimized conversion rates by adding some simple programming, so when Mercy House website visitors click the <a href=""http://mercyhouse.net/donate/"">donate</a> button, a new tab opens up exclusively dedicated to the donation process, ensuring a closed environment free of distractions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By making these three simple changes, Mercy House was able to improve online giving by 110% in just six months, and it didn’t stop there. They continued to enjoy the fruits of their labor and saw an additional 73% increase in the six months after that. The point is, if you take the time to build a solid foundation for the house that is your online giving experience, the sky is the limit to what becomes possible.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">To that end, here are three things we’d recommend you keep in mind while crafting your own values language:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Let your values drive the language.</strong> The language in our values is a lot more direct than it used to be. That’s because directness is one of our values. If one of your values is about being caring, you might consider language that tugs at the heartstrings. If you’re about being passionate, maybe you’ll try language that inspires action.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Be sincere. </strong>Whether defining your values or crafting the expression of them, authenticity is key when it comes your values. Maybe you’d love to be associated with taking risks, but if your work is done democratically or carefully, risk-taking probably won’t ring true as a value.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Use language that speaks to both internal and external audiences.</strong> Values can be an important tool for hiring and staff reviews. They can also help determine what partners and collaborations you might be a part of. The language should speak to those disparate audiences.</p>
</li>

<h3 class=""alt""><b>Rebranding won’t fix your organization’s murky mission.</b></h3>
<p>That’s what strategic planning and other good organizational development processes are for. If someone is telling you to rebrand so you can figure out who or what you really are, &nbsp;they’re putting the cart before the horse, unless rebranding also includes tackling your ‘theory of change’ or other fundamental organizational strategies.&nbsp; Organizations that change the way they communicate <i>after</i> a strategic plan or a change in leadership get better results.</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Rebranding won’t make people behave better. </b></h3>
<p>Rebranding can help create a shared sense of vision or purpose around what you’re trying to communicate, but it won’t fix what ails most bad managers. Defining your organization’s values can be a good place to start, though. <a href=""/express-nonprofit-team-values"" target=""_blank"">Clearly defined organizational values</a>, along with clear practices to bring them to life with your staff and board, can help provide language and guidance when people misbehave. Also, don’t forget to include those difficult personalities in the rebranding process. If they’ve had a chance to participate they are much more likely to support and use the end results. &nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt""><b>Rebranding won’t automatically drive traffic to your website or drop checks in your mailbox. </b></h3>
<p>Think of your rebrand as one on-ramp to a repaved highway of faster, smoother communicating. The fundraising, recruiting, and awareness-raising work you do (e.g., using your new brand) is really what drives supporters. Don’t forget to save time, money, and energy to roll out and integrate your new visuals, messaging, and brand strategy into the pieces your audiences receive every day.</p>
<p>In 2014 Big Duck co-authored a study on the impact rebranding has on nonprofits called <a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_parent""><i>The Rebrand Effect</i></a>. We investigated what nonprofits that rebrand have changed, why they did it, and what effects (positive and negative) those changes had on their staff, fundraising, programs, and more.

<p dir=""ltr"">A smart and effective year-end campaign takes time to prepare and implement—and we recommend you start thinking about it as early as possible (hint: don’t start planning it in November a week before your direct mail piece needs to drop). The good news is that you’ve got time—but there are simple, high-value steps you should take now to ensure you are better positioned to make your 2016 year-end campaign a success.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Consider tackling these five tasks before next year fundraising season:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>1. Improve your online donation experience.</strong> Take a test drive of what it’s like to make a donation on your website. Is your donate button easy to spot on your homepage? Can you get to a donation page within one click from your homepage? Is your donation form simple and clean? Is it as easy as possible to complete a transaction? All of these factors play a role in increasing the likelihood that when potential donors come to your website, they’re likely to actually complete a gift. So if you answered “no” to any of of these questions, get started making changes now!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2. Explore A/B testing.</strong> Most email service providers these days allow A/B testing, and if you haven’t experimented with it yet, give it a try now. Testing is a way to decipher what messages, content, subject lines, photography (and much more!) get better engagement than others. So when you’re crafting year-end appeals, you’ll be able to make more informed decisions based on real data about what messages are bound to resonate with your community.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>3. Clean up your list.</strong>&nbsp;This is one of those tasks that’s not fun in the moment, but is so healthy for you! Cleaning up and organizing your email list and direct mail list can be time-intensive and tedious, but super useful in the long-term. Remove inactive subscribers from your email list to improve deliverability as well as performance rates, and ensure that your constituent records are as complete as possible before year-end rolls around again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>4. Grow your list with quality leads.</strong> Take steps this year to increase the size of your list with good quality fundraising leads. Make it as easy as possible to capture email addresses on your website—a prominent email capture on your homepage should be up there on your list if it isn’t already. Are you giving website visitors a compelling reason to sign up for your email list, and following up with engaging content? If not, get started on optimizing your email signup process.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>5. Ask your community to take action.</strong> To keep your donors engaged between fundraising campaigns, and give your audiences new ways to become a part of your work, ask your community to take action with you in other ways than making a donation. &nbsp;Studies have shown that people are far more likely to donate to your organization if they’ve already taken some sort of action with you. What other simple and meaningful actions can you ask your community to take to help support your cause and advance your mission? When you promote the action—whether it’s a quiz, a survey, a request for a personal story—be sure to also including an email capture so you’re growing your list at the same time.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>For-profit corporations regularly measure awareness and affinity for their brands, but there’s never been a cost-effective way to do the same thing for nonprofits in the United States.

Or boring. What it really means is, when someone says, ""I've got this killer idea, but I don't know where to begin,""&nbsp;I'm ready to swoop in and make sure we've got all the right ingredients, and that we follow the right recipe. That's a pretty amazing skill (if I do say so myself.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do we Project Managers do it? Here's what you need to know&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;get things cooking.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Make your recipe</h3>
<p>Whip up a calendar and start holding yourself—and your team—accountable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take into account the little things. Are there any vacations or special events that you're up against? Any&nbsp;time periods&nbsp;that will cause your&nbsp;team&nbsp;to be heads down and unresponsive?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Don't just look at the big milestones,&nbsp;keep in mind the small steps like&nbsp;internal back-and-forths so that you know who's supposed to get you what&nbsp;and when.&nbsp;Keep things moving.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Get some more cooks in the kitchen (but not too many)</h3>
<p>Build&nbsp;your core team but be selective with who you'll be working with. Too many people&nbsp;can&nbsp;really burn&nbsp;your project&nbsp;and it's&nbsp;outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your working group should be a small set of key decision makers, representative of all&nbsp;trusted&nbsp;voices at your organization. I'd say&nbsp;that any more than six cooks in the kitchen is too much.</li>
<li>Consider when a larger team&nbsp;needs to be involved.&nbsp;Is it once you're halfway in so that&nbsp;you can&nbsp;make updates based on their feedback? Or is it only when you have a finished product?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">Keep your communications well-garnished</h3>
<ul>
<li>Honestly, the biggest secret to getting things done quickly is to customize your process based on who you're speaking to.&nbsp;Lengthy emails generally don't work for most people, so keep yours down to most immediate needs&nbsp;and break it down either by date or task holder.</li>
<li>Need weekly calls or check-ins? Your first response is probably to say you don't. But believe me, this can be the easiest and fastest way to be productive and keep things moving. Even a 15-minute check-in&nbsp;every day or week will keep everyone on track. Most importantly, you'll be able to identify questions or obstacles standing in your way.</li>
<li>Do some taste tests along the way. Consolidate feedback before moving on to the next task&nbsp;so that everyone's happy with the finished product.</li>
</ul>

But these days, nowhere is a brand more comprehensively expressed than on your website.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ultimately, because websites can go so deep and are interactive, they are an ideal place to tell your organization’s story exactly as you want it told—and for your supporters to experience that story in the best way.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">The big picture</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">First of all, websites collect in one place each discrete aspect of your brand—logo, visual system, mission and vision statements, key messages, etc. As the first place most people will go to learn about your organization, your website will (or should) have the more conceptual aspects of your brand—the big idea you represent (positioning) and your organizational personality—baked in at a high level.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">The forms</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your website also houses most of the forms your donors will interact with—list signups, donation forms, pledges, etc. &nbsp;Whether they're subscribing to emails, accessing downloadable materials, registering for events, or taking advocacy actions, the first place they head to is your website. It might feel less obvious, but each of these touchpoints is an opportunity to express your brand. Consider what your forms say about your organization and then ask yourself, “Does that align with our brand?”</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">The navigation bar</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">When someone first lands on your website, whether on the homepage or an inner page, she immediately sees the chapter headings of your story—the navigation bar. Navigation takes visitors through the primary points of your story, dipping into secondary and tertiary pages as necessary.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While it's unlikely anyone is going to ead your website like a book, how you organize information is hugely important. And if your website navigation is truly intuitive and informed by the needs of your various audiences, your website will tell the story it needs to tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you think strategically about designing and writing your website, it can be your brand's digital headquarters—and that's a huge asset!</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://afpfep.org/"" target=""_blank"">Fundraising Effectiveness Project</a> has been studying donor retention rates for years. Their recent study found that only 19% of first-time donors will give again (source: <a href=""http://afpfep.org/reports/"" target=""_blank"">FEP 2016 report</a>). That stat makes me want to gnash my teeth and pull at my hair. After all the hard work we do to attract and inspire that first time gift?? Seriously??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrast that with the 63% of repeat donors who will continue to give, and the writing’s on the wall: focusing on first time donors is key to building a solid base of donors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measuring how many of your first-time donors come back and give again is a no-brainer. It's an easy way to increase your overall donor retention rates and your organization’s overall income.</p>
<p>In his excellent presentation on digital donor retention at the International <a href=""http://afpfc.com/"">Association of Fundraising Professionals</a> conference in March 2016, <a href=""https://bloomerang.co/company/team/steven-shattuck/"">Steven Shattuck</a> offered up practical ways you can help inspire those first-time donors to give again. Here’s the data that informed his suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>First-time donors who get a personal thank you within 48 hours are 4x more likely to give a second gift (source: <a href=""http://aherncomm.com/news.php"">Tom Ahern</a>).</li>
<li>A three-minute thank-you call will boost first-year retention by 30% (source: Roger Craver / <a href=""http://www.theagitator.net/"">The Agitator</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;A thank-you call from a board member to a newly acquired donor within 24 hours of receiving the gift will increase their next gift by 39% (source: <a href=""http://www.burksblog.com"">Penelope Burk</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>While you set these practical tactics in place, don’t forget to benchmark how many of your first-time donors are making second gifts! Doing so, and then pulling that data again at least annually, will help you measure how effective the tactics you experiment with prove to be, and justify their ROI (or not).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">""What’s our overall donor retention?""</h3>
<p>Sector-wide, only 43% of donors give again (median), according to the Fundraising Effectiveness Project’s 2016 report. Steven Shattuck’s surveys reveal that less than 45% of fundraisers know their own nonprofit’s donor retention rates. <b></b></p>
<p>Track your donor retention rates each year to see how you compare, and to set more realistic targets for your growth. Bloomerang’s handy <a href=""https://bloomerang.co/resources/downloadables/"">Donor Retention Math Made Simple</a> tool will teach you how.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">""What’s the quality of our relationship with donors and awareness in the public like?""</h3>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.studyfundraising.com/about-us/professor-adrian-sargeant/"">Dr. Adrian Sargeant</a>, understanding your donors’ satisfaction, commitment, and trust are essential to ensuring the quality of the relationship you have with them, not just the amount and frequency of their giving. That’s essential if you want to move past transactional fundraising into relational fundraising.</p>
<p>But how do you benchmark the satisfaction of your donors or levels of awareness and affinity with people who aren’t giving to you already?</p>
<p>Many organizations conduct their own donor surveys and other forms of custom research to supplement what their numbers already tell them, either using DIY tools like Survey Monkey or hiring researchers to help.</p>
<p>However you do it, consider repeating the same study at regular intervals so you can establish a benchmark and measure your progress against it (ideally every year or two). Don’t forget to build a line-item into your organization’s annual budget for conducting research to ensure you can do it consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, Big Duck launched a new way to benchmark and track awareness, affinity and engagement for your organization in both the public and with your own list, too (<a href=""/brandraising-barometer"" target=""_blank"">details are here</a>).</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1","Development questions for nonprofits","","","topics for development professionals","fundraising donors retention","fundraising training afp donors retention","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/colinkinner/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Colin Kinner's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""66"">Colin Kinner</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p>The most successful rebranding projects tend to follow good organizational development processes such as strategic planning—when an organization’s path forward is clearest. Fifty-one percent of the respondents in Big Duck and FDR Group’s online survey, whose data informed the <a href=""http://Rebrand%20Effect%20e-book""><em>Rebrand Effect</em> ebook</a>, noted that a new focus of their work and/or a new strategic plan was a significant catalyst for rebranding. Not only that, but organizations that have completed some sort of organizational development process also see better results than organizations that rebrand without one.</p>
<p>Here is a three-year rebranding process. You can certainly do it faster if your resources permit.</p>
<p><strong>Year One: Are Your Vision and Mission Still Clear?</strong></p>
<p>If it has been a while since your last strategic-planning session, start now. (Many organizations regularly undertake some form of strategic planning every three to five years.) Focus on getting your board and staff aligned around your work. This process often involves hearing from leadership as well as the donors, volunteers, clients, and others who make up the external fabric of your organization, through formal or informal research.</p>
<p><strong>Year Two: How Do Your Current Communications Stack Up?</strong></p>
<p>Consider field testing your existing communications to assess their effectiveness. What’s your reputation like in the field? What do donors or clients understand about you based on your website or other materials they receive? What’s the buzz about you in their circles?</p>
<p>If what you hear reflects your vision and mission well, there’s no reason to make changes. But, if you’re not happy about what you are hearing, start by setting a new communications strategy and realigning the necessary elements to reflect it. Year two should also include updating or overhauling your website and other online properties, since that’s where most people will interact with you. Train your staff and board on the new brand, and consider integrating it into your human resources practices so that staff are consistently trained and coached to be effective brand ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>Year Three: Are You Communicating with One Voice? </strong></p>
<p>By year three, make sure you’re developing campaigns and stand-alone materials that are on message and on brand, so that everything you produce looks and feels consistent, regardless of who’s producing it. Is your social media on brand? How about that speech your executive director is about to give? Your e-news? Are you communicating with one voice throughout the organization? In other words, would an outsider experience the various ways you communicate as reflecting one (your) organization’s vision and mission? If not, consider appointing someone on your team to review and coach others to help ensure consistency. Twice a year, review you’re your communications informally (on screen or via printouts) to see how you are doing.</p>
<p>No matter how long the steps in this process take, remember that doing them right should always trump doing them fast. Significant changes to your visual identity and messaging that help shape your internal culture and your external reputation should have a long shelf life, after all.</p>

What should be done if a particular program or initiative is more visible or better-known &nbsp;than the organization itself?</p>","<p dir=""ltr"">More and more nonprofits seem to be struggling with how to organize communications about their organization versus specific programs, which are often considered ‘sub-brands’. How should an organization visually represent the new program they’re rolling out? What should be done if a particular program or initiative is more visible or better-known &nbsp;than the organization itself?</p>
<p>If you’re asking yourself any of these questions, fear not! We’ve got an answer—brand architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brand architecture is a strategy for organizing and expressing the hierarchy of your brand. It embraces not just how your organization itself communicates, but also the relationship of programs to the ‘mother ship’ so your target audiences understand the relationships between them. It defines the roles of each part of your brand and gives them defined rules for use. Getting all of this organized and expressing it in a clear way helps audiences to not only understand what your organization does, but to see it holistically, rather than as a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>We have a couple best practices when it comes to developing a strategy for brand architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your communications goals in mind:</strong> Updating your brand architecture should be about more than just getting logos in order. It should work toward your larger communication goals, such as increasing program membership or raising money.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Visualize it:</strong> Brand architecture can easily become complicated and tough to articulate. Try drawing out the hierarchy or relationships between initiatives, or even show how it might play out on some of your materials to get a sense of what it all means.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple</strong><strong>:</strong> There are many brand architecture structures to consider, ranging from simple to complex, and we recommend keeping your strategy as simple as possible. If your brand structure creates confusion internally, you can bet external audiences won’t understand it.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Use it consistently</strong><strong>:</strong> As with your logo or messaging, brand architecture requires consistent use to truly resonate with your audiences. Make sure there are strict rules in place for using your new strategy and circulate them staff-wide. Because brand architecture influences sub-brands and programs, updates will affect more than just your communications staff, so make sure everyone’s on board.</li>

<p>A few years ago, Omar Mahmoud, chief of market knowledge for UNICEF’s private fundraising and partnership division, presented at the United Nations on the topic of corporate/nonprofit partnerships. Corporations are increasingly partnering with nonprofits to boost their credibility and trust, and the conference was designed to help nonprofits become more brand-savvy as they build collaborative programs with private sector businesses.</p>
<p>After a few slides highlighting the expected corporate mega-brands, Mahmoud, who worked at Procter &amp; Gamble before he joined UNICEF, shifted gears into less expected territory. He talked about the brands of icons like Barack Obama and  David Beckham. Next, he shared an example of India’s campaign to rebrand the  entire country to encourage tourism and investment—which included training  everyone from customs officers to taxi drivers—in order to change visitor perceptions and influence tourism. Lastly, he covered nonprofit brands like Greenpeace, Amnesty International and beyond.</p>
<p>In more intimate settings, Mahmoud prefers to illustrate the power of branding by asking people whether they prefer Coke or Pepsi, then giving them a blind taste test. This experiment regularly highlights the difference between a brand and a product; often the brand consumers say they prefer is not the product they say tastes better.</p>
<p>“The same thing can be applied to fundraising,” said Mahmoud. “If you send the same mailing under different organizations’ names, you’d get different results.”</p>
<p>Years ago, branding was considered the purview of corporations alone. But in recent years, branding is increasingly considered a useful strategy for nonprofits, too—particularly those that are struggling to distinguish themselves from peers when competition for donors, members or clients heats up.</p>
<p>But what does the word “brand” mean for nonprofits today?</p>
<p><strong>Branding Defined</strong><br />Branding is, first and foremost, about perceptions. Your nonprofit has a brand whether or not you have a fancy logo, a snappy tagline or a style guide. In every interaction, you’re shaping perceptions, deliberately or accidentally.</p>
<p>“Many nonprofit organizations still avoid using the ‘brand’ word, and prefer to talk about reputation,” said Mahmoud. “The trouble with ‘reputation’ is that it has defensive connotations, and it makes people think of protecting their organization’s reputation, making them even more conservative and risk-averse than they already are. However, while branding involves protecting the organization’s reputation, it also involves the constructive act of building brand equity.”</p>
<p>Branding (or rebranding) an organization involves proactively and deliberately trying to shape or influence perceptions. Doing so requires understanding how you’re perceived, defining how you want to be perceived, clarifying how you communicate to make sure it’s heading in the right direction, and communicating consistently. Branding isn’t a one-time proposition. It’s an ongoing process.</p>
<p><strong>The Elements That Make Up Your Brand<br /></strong>There are certain elements that most experts agree represent a brand. These are often the elements they review, refine or create in a rebranding process. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand strategy</li>
<li>Visual elements (logo, colors, type, imagery)</li>
<li>Messaging elements (name; tagline; vision, mission and values statements; key messages, boilerplate, elevator pitch)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ever have a bad customer experience that makes you swear you’ll never shop in that store again? That’s a brand touchpoint too.  Experiences, just as much as elements we see, hear and read, shape our perceptions about brands, but are often overlooked when a nonprofit considers rebranding.</p>
<p>Staff interactions, office culture, technology (for instance, your voicemail system or website) and physical spaces (for instance, how friendly and welcoming your office is) are elements that can also have a big influence on how your nonprofit’s brand is perceived.</p>
<p>After the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.auburnseminary.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Auburn Theological Seminary</a>&nbsp;rebranded in 2010,  it elected to redesign its annual fundraising breakfast, “Lives of  Commitment,” to be more consistent with the brand it was trying to create. The event honors women from diverse religious backgrounds who are all powerful agents of social change. In years past, honorees were each given a small potted ivy plant, symbolic of Auburn’s  history. To be more consistent with its new brand, Auburn’s staff  created a new ritual of pouring water over each honoree’s hands  using a vessel inscribed with its new tagline: “Trouble the waters, heal the world.” The effect was profound; event attendees now felt they were observing a ritual of deep significance.</p>

<p><strong><br />What Is a Brand Strategy?<br /></strong>Successfully changing how your nonprofit is perceived begins by gathering insights from the audiences you need to communicate with.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wcs.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Wildlife Conservation Society</a>&nbsp;(WCS) is a conservation  behemoth, managing hundreds of projects in more than 60 countries and educating millions of visitors through its Bronx Zoo and New York Aquarium. After strategic planning, WCS engaged agency Wolff Olins to help it translate its new plan into a more consumer-friendly brand strategy.</p>
<p>“WCS has beloved, nationally recognized assets like the Bronx Zoo, while our parent brand, which has a global conservation focus, isn’t as well-known among U.S. audiences,” said Bertina Ceccarelli, executive vice president for global resources for WCS. “Our goal was to bring it all together into one brand strategy and organizational voice that consumers find powerful and feel inspired to support.  “The leap was to view our work from the outside, not the inside. Internally, we pride ourselves on our exceptional commitment to science and delivery of conservation results, but we haven’t always understood fully how consumers, donors and partners see the uniqueness of our work.”</p>
<p>The organization conducted surveys, interviews and panel discussions to surface the perceptions of audiences ranging from staff, partners in the conservation world, individual and corporate supporters, trustees, activists, zoo visitors and more. “We Stand for Wildlife” emerged as the connective tissue, and it became WCS’s new brand position.</p>
<p>“Everything we do throughout this organization flows back to that single idea,” said Ceccarelli. “A strong brand further strengthens your ability to do your mission. While it can be hard to break out of the internal set of memes, WCS will ultimately be more successful in raising awareness and support if our brand connects to our audiences both intellectually and emotionally.”</p>
<p>WCS is rolling out new logo, visual, messaging, website and other brand elements at the end of 2015, all of which derive from its new brand strategy, “We Stand for Wildlife.” The organization commissioned Pentagram, an international design firm, to create the new brand identity.</p>
<p>A brand strategy is key to translate the nuts and bolts of your organization’s strategic plan into tools that will help you communicate. Talk to a dozen firms that do branding work and you’ll hear terms like “brand essence,” “brand connector,” “positioning” and “personality” bandied about. These are all different approaches to brand strategy, and when done well, they should define the tone, style and basic understanding of what your organization should be.</p>
<p>The best brand strategies are simple, clear and distinguishing from others in your space. If your new brand strategy could work just as well for a peer organization that may also be courting your donors, consider pushing it further.&nbsp;<a href=""https://donate.charitywater.org/donate/newyear"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Charity: Water</a>, for instance, quickly distinguished  itself in the clean water movement from organizations like WaterAid or Water for People and raised significant funding by differentiating itself as a fun, youthful, hip organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Visuals and Messages<br /></strong>The term “branding” emerged from the ranching industry, when  cattle were branded to make sure their ownership was indisputable.  For this reason, people often associate branding with logos, and consider a change in logo to be rebranding.</p>
<p>While many organizations do elect to change their logo when they rebrand, changing only a logo may not shift how your organization is perceived. Often, changing other visuals, such as the colors, typefaces and images you use, can be just as significant.</p>
<p>The best logos are simple, flexible and timeless. While it’s tempting to try to pack everything and the kitchen sink into a small mark, it’s often less effective than something that’s simple enough to work on your website, as a social media avatar, in large signage on your building or at your event, and on your business cards. Think of Target’s simple bull’s-eye, Coca-Cola’s timeless typography or the bold clarity of FedEx’s logo.</p>
<p>While logos are commonly used and understood, many nonprofits struggle to understand and define their messaging, which can be inherently more complicated. Messaging starts with an organization’s name and tagline. Are they clear? Memorable? Does your name work well in URL form or when abbreviated? Your organization’s name is often its most widely traveled ambassador. But it’s not just about your name—your vision and mission statements, values key messages, boilerplate copy and elevator pitch each serve a distinct purpose, and must function together and separately.</p>
<p>Most organizations create brand guides, often called style guides, which include the organization’s brand strategy, visuals and messaging, and usage guidelines. Staff, particularly those who communicate externally on behalf of the organization, will likely need to be trained to use these elements, too.</p>
<p><strong>Day-to-Day Brand Experiences<br /></strong>Camber Collective’s recent “Money for Good” 2015 report flags that donors react to “noise” by maintaining a high level of loyalty to their primary causes, and by exhibiting a preference for well-known nonprofits.</p>
<p>Turns out, donors are more likely to give to an organization they’ve heard of. That makes penetrating the noise with credible, authentic communications all the more important for nonprofits.</p>
<p>JetBlue’s hub at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York has free Wi-Fi and stores that feel consistently aligned with JetBlue’s  image. There are casual spaces to sit and snack, and digital conveniences everywhere—an airport for the modern traveler. That’s the essence of what JetBlue wants consumers to associate with its brand.</p>
<p>Creating experiences that allow key audiences to “live the brand” takes creativity. City Year works to bridge the gap in high-poverty  communities between the support that students need, and what their schools are designed and resourced to provide. Its AmeriCorps members  are given bright red jackets emblazoned with the City Year logo and a colorful patch, and are regularly photographed in the field “in uniform.”</p>
<p>Many organizations paint their values prominently on the walls, or even print them on notepads, inspiring staff to keep them top-of-mind.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes a Brand Great?<br /></strong>Branding and other communications are strategies that should help  advance your organization’s work. When a nonprofit’s strategy, visuals and messages are also reflected in the culture of its work and the experiences its audience has, greatness emerges.</p>
<p>The strongest brands in any sector are consistent, authentic to the work itself, and reflected not just in marketing materials, but in just about everything the organizations do.</p>
<p><strong>But Is It Worth It?</strong><br /><a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">“The Rebrand Effect,”</a>&nbsp;a study by Big Duck and FDR Group conducted in 2014, showed a strong correlation between rebranding a nonprofit and increased revenue, recruitment, media attention and staff confidence. But timing is critical, too.</p>
<p>The best time to change your brand is often after a change in leadership (e.g., when that new executive director starts, not just before they leave) or right after strategic planning. Whatever you change, particularly if it’s an improvement, should inspire staff and board alike to communicate in new ways.</p>
<p><a href=""http://curesma.org/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Opens in a new window"">Cure SMA</a>, a national organization that needed to attract donors who weren’t directly affected by the disease, nearly doubled its income at year-end 2014 using its new brand. Timing was everything—staff used the new visuals, messaging and story to engage existing and new donors, generating a 43 percent increase in the overall number of gifts.</p>
<p>Embarking on a rebrand is a lot like renovating your home. It will take time, cost money, and require careful planning and implementation. Tread carefully: It’s better to wait, build buy-in from your board and staff, and make sure there are no derailing changes in leadership or huge changes coming first.</p>

Elizabeth Barajas-<span>Román</span> spoke about her path to becoming CEO of&nbsp;<b>the <a href=""http://www.womensfund.net"" target=""_blank"">Women's Fund of Western Massachusetts</a>.</b></b></p>
<p>""The Women’s Fund of Western Massachusetts is a public foundation that partners with donors to invest about $500,000 a year in projects that impact women and girls. We also run the only nonpartisan program in the state that trains women to run for public office. And in the past two years since I’ve become CEO, we’ve increased our individual donations by 54 percent, doubled the number of new donors, increased visibility with earned media, and had a 400 percent increase in social media presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to be leading the organization. But stepping into this role meant overcoming the kind of barriers that impact most women professionals.</p>
<p>I’m a first generation Mexican-American. Growing up, my siblings and I didn’t have much, but among our few treasures were books that my mother bought from the thrift store for a dollar a bagful. While my mother cleaned houses to make ends meet, she also checked out audio cassettes at the library on business and accounting, and she rented instructional videos on basic computer skills. Before long, she turned her hourly gigs into a thriving small business. This enterprise allowed her to raise five kids, and send them all to college.</p>
<p>When I told my mother that I had gotten into Harvard, she said, “Yea! Mija, I’m so happy.” Then after a pause, “Is that a good school?” Even though she didn’t immediately appreciate the accomplishment, I knew I could not have gotten to that point if it were not for those one dollar bag-of-books that I reread until the bindings broke – if it were not for my mother’s ability to access a free public library– if it were not for all that she taught me about what is possible when you are willing to learn quickly and fearlessly, because backing down or going back is just not an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why I’m passionate about access to education and social change. And why I’ve spent my career creating and maintaining partnerships that help make a measurable impact on the lives of our most vulnerable community members.</p>
<p>Among nonprofits with budgets in excess of $25 million, women constitute only 21 percent of leadership roles, even though they make up 75 percent of the workforce. While there is a lot of data about the reason why we’ve gained so little ground regarding women in leadership, I think they all can be boiled down to two issues we have to work on together, and one issue we can focus on individually.</p>
<p>The first issue is the structural – this one we’re in together. There are specific policies that exist that maintain the status quo. These include discrimination in hiring, promotion and pay. How do we overcome these? Support the groups in your region working to pass bills that address issues like gender discrimination in pay, affordable childcare and universal pre-kindergarten.</p>
<p>The second issue is cultural. It’s important to shift the culture of gender discrimination in the work place. We’re working together on this one, too.</p>
<p>Gender discrimination includes sexual harassment, occupational segregation, bias against mothers, and other ways in which women workers and women’s work are undervalued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative around women’s work that we must combat. There is an underlying sexism that we can’t ignore. While the fundraising sector encompasses many different types of jobs, there are jobs that women end up doing. And those jobs are valued less not because of the skills it takes to do those jobs – but simply because women are doing them. This sexist measuring stick follows us – even as we take traditionally male jobs like capital and major gifts, CEO and president.</p>
<p>Together we can shift this dialogue. Together we can leverage the power of our constituencies to reject the sexist measuring stick. Every day, we can help create the opportunity to shift bias.</p>
<p>The last barrier is personal. Men apply for a job when they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100 percent of them. Some of this is about confidence. But some of this is also about perception. A 2014 Harvard Business School Review article found that when women chose not to apply for a job it was because they thought they wouldn’t be chosen due to lacking some qualifications. These women, however, felt confident they could do the job if given a chance.</p>
<p>This data seems to show that women suffer from a mistaken perception of the hiring process. When evaluating a candidate hiring managers will consider advocacy, relationships, or a creative approach to framing expertise. Unfortunately, too many women think their resume needs to do all the talking. Demystifying the hiring process could go a long way in helping women step up into advanced positions.</p>
<p>Women are taught that they must work harder, be more prepared, and more is expected of them in order to succeed. This attitude sometimes makes it hard for women to imagine themselves in a position they are not over prepared to tackle. But it is perfectly acceptable, and expected, to learn on the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like my mother, I know we all have the power and passion to turn the possible into reality. I invite you to join me in changing the structural and cultural barriers that remain so that we can all have the careers we deserve.""</p>

<p>Branding livestock with a rancher’s unique mark to distinguish them from other ranchers’ stock was common practice long ago. Perhaps that’s why up until quite recently, people thought of rebranding as just a logo change. Although few of us have ranching experience, the term ‘branding’ has taken root and been adopted by individuals and organizations alike.</p>
<p>Today, ""rebranding"" is more commonly defined as a change in both visual and written elements; a bit more expansive than your logo, but still very much about the elements you use to communicate with external audiences. But your visuals and messaging—for instance, your name, logo, and tagline—are only as powerful as the strategy that drives them, the ways you communicate them, your ability to truly live them authentically, and how they are perceived.</p>
<p>Branding is about changing perception and growing reputation; often from the inside out. Deep shifts in how people work, organizational culture, and more might be in order.</p>
<p>To determine what rebranding really means for your nonprofit, you first need to agree on the model you’ll find most useful. And, in recent years, many different models have emerged to help businesses understand and change how they communicate in more sophisticated ways. Study branding and you’ll hear terms like “brand essence” or “brand connector” bandied about.</p>
<p>Big Duck coined the term ""brandraising"" (yes, we’ve created our own snappy branding model, too) to describe something larger and more holistic. <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising</a>&nbsp;is a communications framework that begins with a nonprofit’s vision, mission, and values, and threads its way through everything the organization does, internally and externally, to reach the people necessary to fundraise, run programs, advocate, and more.

<p>As a business founder myself, I realized I’m regularly disgruntled, too. Big changes or subtle tweaks that would bring the vision more effectively to life, and the gap that represents ""room for improvement,"" is often the first thing I see. &nbsp;</p>

You learned some great theories and saw some wonderful case studies, but there was no time to process what you learned or determine how to put it into action. Fret not! We may have the professional development/capacity-building/skills development approach you’ve been looking for: <a href=""/search/index.php?findtext=immersives"">Immersive workshops</a>.</p>
<p>Immersive workshops represent a new approach to training. We help you not only discover the <em>why</em> and the <em>what</em> behind a topic—but also give you time to start wrapping your head around the <em>how</em>. We’ve also designed the curriculum of these one- and two-day sessions to allow for an active exchange of ideas between a small group of participants. Every session will help you better understand the importance of a topic and how to talk about it with your colleagues, offer some data to help you make the case, and then provide you with tools to create initial strategies and plans. And if you take the course with colleagues from your own organization, you’ll not only have someone who understands your new way of thinking and can help you implement your ideas, you’ll also get a discount on registration!</p>
<p>We will be teaching <a href=""/search/index.php?findtext=immersives"">four Immersive workshops this Summer</a>. Each session also includes a post-workshop coaching session with us either as part of the fee or for those who register early. If you work for a smaller nonprofit, consider taking the Immersive workshop on <a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-boot-camp"">branding</a> or <a href=""/multichannel-fundraising-bootcamp"">year-end fundraising campaigns</a>. If you work with a nonprofit that wants to increase the funds it gets from individual donors, consider taking the Immersive workshop on <a href=""/nyc-fundraising-plan-bootcamp"">donor communications planning</a> (with a <a href=""/washington-dc-fundraising-plan-bootcamp"">special session in DC</a>, too!).</p>
<p><a href=""/sarah-durham"">Sarah</a> will lead the first Immersive on July 14 on <a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-boot-camp"">setting and using your nonprofit's brand strategy</a>. Whether you’ve read her book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brandraising-Nonprofits-Visibility-Through-Communications/dp/0470527536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263236093&amp;sr=8-1"">Brandraising</a>, or have been pondering when and how you might change your brand, this one-day Immersive workshop at Big Duck will will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain a clear understanding of what brand strategy is and how it can help guide your communications with donors and other audiences</li>
<li>Set the tone and style for all of your communications</li>
<li>Evaluate which elements of your brand are working or not working—strategically, not subjectively</li>
</ul>
<p>The early bird deadline for this session in June 8. <a href=""/nonprofit-brand-strategy-boot-camp"">You can learn more here</a> and we hope to see you at one or more of these Immersive workshops this Summer!</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1066%2,1405%3,1406%4","New brand strategy seminar for nonprofits","","","small nonprofit communications workshops","brandraising campaigns workshops immersives","brandraising campaigns workshops immersives","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/randy-peralta/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Randy Peralta's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""67"">Randy Peralta</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">If you’re working with a disgruntled optimist, here are few techniques the Ducks use that might help.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Lead with solutions.</strong> People in management roles know you’re going to tell them about problems; that’s par for the course. But being told a problem without an idea or two for a good solution can make a manager feel they have to do it all. When something goes wrong, think through the options and propose a solution they can understand and support. Odds are, your good solutions will help set you up for faster professional growth too, as your manager comes to rely on you for your problem-solving super powers. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remove the work they’re bad at.</strong> Most founders and entrepreneurs are big picture “visionary” types who are best kept out of the weeds. Observe where your disgruntled optimist adds the most value for your organization and minimize their distractions.</p>
<p><strong>Give them time alone to do deep work.</strong> &nbsp;In his book, “Deep Work”, author Cal Newport advocates for the importance of time to focus deeply in today’s (often shallow) task-oriented world. &nbsp;Innovators and leaders of all kinds need time to think through complex problems, which often takes deep focus. Constant meetings, email, and interuptions might help the day-to-day keep moving, but you’ll find your disgruntled optimist adds more value (and might even be nicer to work with) if they get a few hours of solitude each week to do the thinking, writing, or planning that’s most critical.</p>
<p><strong>Dot your I’s and cross your T's.</strong> Farrell Evans, CEO of the Bridge Golf Foundation, notes that a good journalist is always looking for where a story might fall down. Doing your own due diligence and presenting solid work that doesn’t have obvious holes in it already will help build your disgruntled optimist’s trust.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1","Working with nonprofit EDs","","","managing up with CEOs ","internal leadership staff","internal leadership staff sarah CEO","<p><span>Image by&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/toddle_email_newsletters/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Alan O'Rourke's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""30"" target=""_blank"">Alan O'Rourke</a><span>&nbsp;(Flickr, altered)</span></p>",

It is the starting point for smart, effective communications that set you apart, inspire people to get involved, kickstart your fundraising, and change hearts and minds.</p>
<p name=""42b7"" id=""42b7"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">We asked&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/farra"" data-href=""http://www.twitter.com/farra"" class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"">Farra Trompeter</a>, Vice President of&nbsp;Big Duck, a communications firm that works exclusively with nonprofits, how artists and arts organizations can apply brandraising concepts to increase visibility and raise funds.</p>
<h3 name=""02d7"" id=""02d7"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">If you were just starting an arts business, what are the first 3 things you would want to clarify about your identity in order to begin brandraising?</h3>
<p name=""a2a6"" id=""a2a6"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">First things first, figure out who you’re trying to reach. Who is your target audience? What are they like? And most importantly, what do you want them to think about you? Your brand is what people say it is, and you can influence that with every set of communications and interactions.</p>
<p name=""1549"" id=""1549"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">Next, to guide perception, we use something called a positioning statement. It’s a phrase that captures the big idea you hope to own in the minds of your target audience. To determine your positioning, you’ll need to figure out what makes you unique in your space. Do a landscape scan of organizations out there doing similar work and identify what sets you apart — then own it.</p>
<p name=""586a"" id=""586a"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">Finally, in addition to defining what you want your audiences to think of you, you need to decide what you’d like them to feel about you too. Personality represents the overarching feelings you want associated with you, exemplified by your tone and style. Ask yourself questions like “If my organization were an animal, what would it be? What characteristics do my organization and that animal share?” The adjectives you answer with might make up your personality.</p>
<h3 name=""c78a"" id=""c78a"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">For experienced arts-entrepreneurs, what are some warning signs that their brand might need a makeover?</h3>
<p name=""45dc"" id=""45dc"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">In the brandraising process, the first step is creating a brand strategy which means writing those positioning and personality statements described above. The next step is making sure your brand strategy is reflected in your brand identity — how your organization looks, feels, and sounds.</p>
<p name=""dc6f"" id=""dc6f"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">Do your name, logo, and tagline reflect your positioning and personality? Does the “about us” section on your website really reflect what makes you you? If you’re not sure, ask your coworkers or friends…better yet, ask your target audience! If they don’t see your strategy reflected in your identity, it might be time for a makeover.</p>
<h3 name=""bfcf"" id=""bfcf"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">For businesses rolling out version 2.0 of their brand, do you have any recommendations for a seamless transition and keeping their existing customers?</h3>
<p name=""18ff"" id=""18ff"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">Before you decide on the type of rollout you want for your brand, determine if the changes are an evolution or revolution. Have you updated your brand in small ways, or have you given yourself or your organization a total makeover?</p>
<p name=""3cce"" id=""3cce"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">If the changes you’ve made are fairly subtle, try a rolling launch. Update old materials as they run out, and make changes to major communications pieces like the website when time and budget allow. You might also consider phased launch, updating your core materials in phases — perhaps tackling your online materials first, then moving to print — and informally announcing the new brand at an event.</p>
<p name=""5202"" id=""5202"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">If the changes you’ve made are major, especially around your name and logo, consider flipping the switch on your new brand. Unveil your new brand, perhaps at an event or opening, and make sure all your core materials reflect the updates. Before you flip the switch, give key stakeholders and engaged supporters a sneak peek of the new brand so they’re not overwhelmed by the changes and feel part of the excitement.</p>
<h3 name=""8029"" id=""8029"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">To what extent should a company’s brand be a reflection of the personality of its founders?</h3>
<p name=""8074"" id=""8074"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">Tough question! Sometimes the founder’s personality goes hand-in-hand with the company’s brand. This is especially true in the early years of an organization as it works to find its voice.</p>
<p name=""5d45"" id=""5d45"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">As the organization grows, it’s likely that audiences will be drawn to the entity itself, without any attachment to the founder, so the company should be able to stand on its own. This means carving out specific positioning and personality for the organization to use to guide how it communicates across every interaction.</p>
<h3 name=""da7f"" id=""da7f"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">How do you convince skeptical organizations that they need to do more than redesign their logo in order to rebrand?</h3>
<p name=""2501"" id=""2501"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">It really goes back to brand strategy, and helping them understand the importance of communicating their positioning and personality in everything they do. If that doesn’t do the trick, I find that doing a landscape scan together can help organizations see any issues around distinction or sophistication — or lack thereof.</p>
<p name=""fc67"" id=""fc67"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p"">It also might be helpful to do a little audience research about the brand. If donors, supporters or other important audience members comment on the logo or express desire for a more refreshed look, it might give the organization the push they need to consider that redesign.</p>
<h3 name=""cfa5"" id=""cfa5"" class=""graf--p graf-after--p alt"">Do you have any resources for our readers who want to do further research on brandraising?</h3>

I’m totally down with Vu on this one.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Vu Lee, the powerhouse behind the fabulous “Nonprofits With Balls” blog, recently wrote an excellent piece titled, “<a href=""http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2016/05/why-organizational-values-are-so-awesome-and-sexy/"">Why Values are So Awesome And Sexy</a>”. I’m totally down with Vu on this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Values are awesome and sexy because they create a decision-making framework that will help you create something new, fix something broken, or solve many sticky problems. Big Duck’s <a href=""/big-duck-company-values"" target=""_blank"">values are on our website</a>, posted throughout our office, and regularly referred to in all sorts of ways. They’re also a core component of <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">our brandraising&nbsp;work</a> with clients.</p>
<p>Seasoned major gifts officers know that building a relationship with a prospect or donor is essential. But, in my experience, they don’t always see how their organization’s core values can help them do their job better, too.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons fundraisers benefit when they discuss values with major donors.</p>
<p><b>1. When you’re looking to create a connection that extends beyond individuals.</b> Donors form real attachments to executive directors, senior development staff, or other specific people. That’s great at first, but over time, that attachment must grow beyond an individual and become about the organization itself.</p>
<p>Asking questions like, “Which of our core values resonates most deeply for you?” and, “Are there any values here that you feel less connected to?” can begin to surface deeper emotional connections that extend beyond any individual. If they’re asked by someone other than the person who is the primary focus on the relationship, they can also help the donor connect more deeply with other individuals on your team.</p>
<p><b>2. When you’re looking to create a connection to the organization, not just the program.</b> Similarly, values can help you start a discussion about the&nbsp; organization’s work overall, and see why they may care about other initiatives, too. Let’s say I’m particularly inspired to support your children’s initiatives. Understanding how your programs for adults are actually guided by the same values might help me identify and connect myself with those programs, too.</p>
<p><b>3. To inspire larger and/or unrestricted giving over time.</b> Making an unrestricted gift is one way a donor shows your organization that they support your approach and want to see you succeed organizationally. Donors who share you values are more likely to trust that you’ll spend their money wisely because they can identify on a more emotional level with your work.</p>
<p>Of course, your values can’t be lip-service. Share them with your donors when they are truly alive and thriving in your organization. If they aren’t, consider integrating a module about values into your next strategic planning session, or <a href=""/contentmgr/bigducknyc.com/contact"" target=""_blank"">give us a shout</a>, and we can help. &nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1","Using values in major gifts","","","organizational values to raise money","fundraising campaigns values","fundraising campaigns values","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chaparral/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Chapendra's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""30"">Chapendra</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>",

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Maybe you’re already thinking about this…You probably know that nonprofits receive a significant portion of their individual donations during the final quarter of the year, especially in December. It’s the season of giving, after all.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But why do we care about it right now? Too often, we see campaigns that miss out on making a connection between this moment of generosity and who you are. When you’re fundraising, be sure you don’t lose sight of the importance of your brand. It’s your biggest asset. Take full advantage of it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A new, out-of-left field fundraising campaign might result in some short-term gain. But you could simultaneously be doing yourself a long-term disservice.</span></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of any fundraising campaign, especially at year-end, is to get your donors to feel like they are essential to accomplishing your mission. You do that by making them the star of a consistent, compelling story about your organization. Keep them connected, and your donors will not only give this year, they’ll keep coming back year after year.</p>
<p>During year-end fundraising season, use your brand as your guide for your campaign. At Big Duck, we often tie our clients’ campaigns together with a theme—some kind of hook that will help convince donors that now is the time to support their organization. We take time to figure out the donors’ role in the campaign and how we can celebrate them as the hero.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But as an agency that does branding (or what we call “brandraising”), we also ask whether that hook fits into the larger narrative that is the organization’s brand. Then we play that out across every part of the campaign—from the stories we tell to the design of the email template and copy in the direct mail piece. From the first engagement action to the last thank you note, we see every interaction as a chance to reinforce your brand and your results</span></p>
<p>This isn’t just branding for branding’s sake—it’s about donor engagement. You want to connect the season of giving with your overall organization so that donors can feel a part of your ongoing story, rather than seeing your fundraising efforts as somehow separate.</p>
<p><span><span>If you’re feeling overwhelmed at the idea of planning a killer fundraising campaign that seamlessly connects to your organization’s brand, fear not! </span><a href=""/year-end-fundraising""><span>Big Duck is offering three opportunities</span></a><span> to help nonprofits run successful fundraising campaigns this year end. </span></span></p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1405%2,1413%3,1410%4,1067%5","Year-end campaign communications","","","branding boosts holiday giving","branding fundraising brandraising donors campaigns","branding fundraising brandraising donors campaigns dan gunderman","",

<p>Difference is not deficit.</p>
<p>For those of us in the communications industry, attending to our differences helps us craft messages with meaningful impact. Across industries, doing so makes us stronger. And as individuals, it can help us flourish.</p>
<p>When it comes to diversity, I believe we are approaching a tipping point in America. Boycotts by leading companies in response to discriminatory legislation in Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina demonstrate that the business community is well on its way to a progressive consensus. And it’s not just the business community. Bruce Springsteen’s cancellation of a concert in North Carolina has been a clear message that discrimination is unacceptable, and others in the entertainment and sports industries have followed suit. The NCAA announced that they will not host any future events – from Final Four championships to education conferences – in cities without inclusive and anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>We’re also hearing it from the leaders in our country. At our Washington Conference in April, a longstanding tradition where the Ad Council Board meets with White House staff and other influencers, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (one of only 20 women in the Senate) spoke passionately about how diversity of backgrounds leads to greater perspectives and solutions. And at the 4As Conference in Miami I heard passionate, personal statements about diversity from executives at many of the leading ad agencies. There was a sense of urgency to what people were saying and a curiosity about how they might utilize their growing awareness. It felt to me as if we, as a collective, are more ready than ever to take meaningful action.</p>
<p>There is a strong business case to be made for diversity, as well. According to McKinsey, the US could add up to $4.3 trillion in annual GDP by 2025 if we achieved full gender parity in the workplace. A study of over 180 publicly traded companies in the EU and the US demonstrated that those with more diverse boards of directors performed better than average by a number of different metrics. And in the advertising business, case studies show that brands that showcase diversity in their campaigns have a more positive perception among millennials.</p>
<p>But what practical actions can we take to foster diversity in our own lives?</p>
<p>The place to start is at the source: by getting honest about our differences and our unconscious biases toward others. No matter how open we think we may be, bias affects all of us. According to research by the Perception Institute, 85% of Americans consider themselves to be without bias, when in fact the vast majority of us carry biases that exist and operate beneath our conscious awareness. We do 98% of our thinking in our unconscious mind. And that is where we collect and store our implicit biases.</p>
<p>To move the needle on diversity, we need to challenge what we believe about ourselves.</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with Daniel Diez, EVP and Global Chief Marketing Officer at R/GA, the agency that led the collaborative efforts to create&nbsp;<a href=""http://lovehasnolabels.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>Love Has No Labels</em></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnDgZuGIhHs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></p>
<p>Daniel shared with me the poignancy of the moment when those hugging, kissing skeletons on the screen revealed that they were two women. Even though Daniel is both Latino and LGBT, he shared with me, “I did not expect the couple to be the same gender. I was genuinely surprised by my own bias, and that everybody has to be made aware of their own unconscious bias, too.”</p>
<p>I am excited and proud that at the Ad Council we will be implementing unconscious bias training for our entire team. The training starts with diagnostic tests and other exercises designed to help uncover unconscious bias (This&nbsp;<a href=""http://lovehasnolabels.com/#quiz"" target=""_blank"">quiz</a>&nbsp;on our&nbsp;<em>Love Has No Labels</em>&nbsp;site is a great place where anyone can get started). It continues with guided workshops that model ways we can all begin to change our thinking and our behavior. Examples include role playing interviews and customer interactions with people of other gender identities, racial groups, sexualities, age groups, and other areas of diversity. The tests and workshops are not meant to be a complete solution to unconscious bias, but the start of an evolutionary process.</p>
<p>All change, no matter how sweeping, must start on a personal level.</p>
<p>Reprogramming personal bias requires active incorporation of those who are different from us. When crafting campaigns, we must make sure that the diversity in the room represents the sociocultural depth and breadth of our audience.</p>
<p>If we can broaden the conversation and keep it honest and authentic, I believe we can turn this moment into an inflection point for our entire industry. In addition to gender and sexuality, we also need to talk about race, religion, age, and all the forms of diversity whose unique perspectives have the potential to enrich our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>Recognizing and talking openly about difference is not easy. It can and often will create tension. But this tension doesn’t have to drive us apart; by working through these difficult conversations we can be propelled forward.</p>
<p>By helping lead the national conversation on diversity, our industry has the power to catalyze significant and meaningful change. Let’s pledge to do that together.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1067%1,1408%2","Diversity in the workplace","","","staff diversity at your organization","diversity organization staff development internal","diversity organization staff development development","",

What could be better than attracting the friends of those who already know and love you?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hailed as a great engagement strategy by some (</span><a href=""/ways-to-show-donors-you-appreciate-them"" target=""_blank""><span>including me!</span></a><span>), others fret over issues of low retention rates and recall. So while your board may celebrate the rising numbers of your donors setting up fundraising pages on your behalf, doing walks/runs/rides, or tweeting about your peer-to-peer fundraising campaign, you may be racked with worry over what comes next.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What’s so great about social fundraising?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The </span><a href=""http://3rdsectorlabs.com/data-analytics/donor-acquisition-costs/"" target=""_blank""><span>cost to acquire a new donor</span></a><span> </span><span>can get expensive or take several years to turn profitable depending on how you are bringing them in. But the price of donors asking their friends may be free to you or just entail a minor administrative charge once you set up the program. I’m a big fan of social fundraising—getting donors or advocates to set up fundraising pages on your behalf and asking their friends to give, often with an ease of sharing across social media. Initially set up as the online version of events where participants were encouraged to get donations for every mile or kilometer that ran, walked, swam, rode, etc., many social fundraising take these classic peer-to-peer fundraising models and offer them virtually.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One benefit here is that social fundraising campaigns are available year-round and can be tied to a donor’s personal milestone or moment (birthdays, tributes or memorials for loved ones, responses to emergencies, etc.). It can be quite motivating to that supporter to raise money for you and be your champion, providing a source of pride in their own accomplishment and association with your great cause.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Often the people who give to the pages your donors set up are inspired to support their friend or give because their friend asked. Think about your own inbox or Facebook newsfeed for a minute—are you more likely to read messages from friends and family or from organizations? Having a donor send or post a personal request can get the clicks you can’t—often from new supporters. And these new supporters bring new funds to your programs and new records to your database.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>So how do you retain and grow champions?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One of the biggest challenges with social or peer-to-peer fundraising is </span><span>retention. </span><span>Most of the people who support these campaigns do so because a friend asked or in response to a particularly timely moment. It’s a bonus when that person gives because they’ve heard of you or care passionately about your mission, but that’s not always the case. While there is no benchmark data related to retention rates for peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns that I know of, the</span><a href=""https://bloomerang.co/blog/infographic-2016-fundraising-effectiveness-project-survey-report/""><span> Association of Fundraising Professionals</span></a><span> did find that the average donor retention rate for all nonprofit fundraising was 46% in 2015, and only 29% for first-time donors. These numbers are likely lower for peer-to-peer campaigns for most nonprofits.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sadly, once these donors hit your database and start getting follow-up appeals from your organization they may never give again, in part because they may have never realized they were giving to your organization in the first place! They remember giving to their friend, but may not have connected with the nonprofit behind it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Beyond retention of donors who gave to these campaigns, there is the retention of the champions themselves. It can be exciting to get a donor to set up a page or participate in your event in the first place—but how many of them are returning to do it again? It can be tempting to want to let social fundraising campaigns take care of themselves, but setting them on auto-pilot may leave champions feeling ignored and unappreciated.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Another issue I’ve seen are when well-intentioned donors unintentionally misrepresent the charity they are trying to help. This can range from using the wrong logo to misstating the mission to false claims about how the funds will be used. Clearly this could cause more harm than good, especially when it goes unnoticed for days or weeks or months at a time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Where should I start?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>First thing you can do is get a handle on what you already have in place. Audit the fundraising pages on your own website and on those of popular tools like Crowdrise, FirstGiving, Classy, Razoo, and CauseVox. Make test donations, set up pages using a personal account, take screenshots of every step in the process on screen and in your inbox, etc. Now do the same with one or two other nonprofits who swim in the same donor pool as your organization. Then take a step back and ask what you might improve. And for even more ideas, </span><a href=""https://www.peertopeerforum.com/wp-content/uploads/Getting-Started-with-Peer-to-Peer-Fundraising-FINAL.pdf""><span>read this in-depth guide</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Then create a plan for how to communicate better with champions and donors. Include ways you can encourage champions to participate and represent you well. Map out the ways you can talk to the donors to those campaigns so they better understand and remember donating to your organization, not just their friend, colleague, or family member.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Need more help? We are here!</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Of course, Big Duck can also help you by clarifying your brand strategy through our brandraising process and analyze or propose new ways for how your social fundraising programs connect back to your brand.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We can also evaluate all the different ways you are appealing to and cultivating individual donors, study your donor motivations (both as fundraising champions and supporters), and develop a roadmap that you can implement with changes you should make based on immediate and long-term priorities. This roadmap factors in our research and knowledge of best practices, and is scaled to your team so that is realistic and practical. </span><a href=""/contact""><span>Contact us if you’d like to explore how we might help</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Dan Pallotta’s May 2016 TED Talk, “The Dream we Haven’t Dared to Dream,” surfaces a long-overdue and, to me, more interesting point about the way our personal lives—even our personal humanity—can suffer as we pursue ambitious visions. His is not a discussion of voice, tone, or style: it’s a discussion of how fully and authentically we live our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The search for authenticity </b></p>
<p><a href=""/a-ceo-on-sabbatical"">Taking a sabbatical</a> the year Big Duck turned 20 (in 2014) provided an opportunity for me to take off my CEO hat for several months and focus instead on other roles that are also a part of my identity. I reconnected with myself as an artist, as a writer, and as a volunteer, for instance. By stepping away from work for several months, I had to let go of many threads I had been gripping tightly at work and entrust them to my staff.</p>
<p>Coming back to work after my sabbatical, I felt clearer than I’d ever been about my own professional voice, talents, and shortcomings. It was much easier than I would have imagined letting go, and terrific to come back to a business where my staff’s contributions regularly outshine my own. My sabbatical reinforced the value of working with my staff in ways that emerge from each of our strengths, and hopefully reduce my own tendency to be overly directive or demanding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Books like Karissa Thacker’s, “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Art-Authenticity-Become-Authentic-Leader/dp/1119153425/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1466278677&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=karissa+thacker"">The Art of Authenticity: Tools to Become and Authentic Leader and Your Best Self</a>” or “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Louder-Than-Words-Harness-Authentic/dp/1501222015"">Louder than Words: Harness the Power of your Authentic Voice</a>” by Todd Henry highlight the necessity of knowing who you really are and bringing your full self to every aspect of your life.</p>
<p><b>Leaders who behave badly</b></p>
<p>When senior-level people commit to projects that require super-human acts without asking or even thanking the staff that will make them happen, problems start to bubble up below the surface. They humiliate and browbeat their own teams in front of donors, consultants, and others, all in the name of “good work.” They can be competitive, cruel, even abusive, to people who are there to serve the same mission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While I doubt these people would admit that they sacrifice being kind, compassionate managers in order to advance the cause, their vision does not seem to include a role for themselves as a leader that’s as generous to the people who work for them as it is to the communities they serve. Some of these people are the nicest, most fun people you’d ever want to hang out with after work. So why do they seem like different people depending on the context?</p>
<p>I wonder if, on the way “up,” some people feel they must be tough in order to stay focused and achieve their goals. Perhaps this is a way of managing what is often referred to as ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" target=""_blank"">impostor syndrome</a>""? It’s as if they are playing a role, rather than finding a truly integrated, authentic way to lead.</p>
<p>Over time, the humanity and compassion that likely drew them to the nonprofit sector has become less accessible.</p>
<p><b>What inspiring authentic leaders look like</b></p>
<p>In 2014, Ford Foundation’s Darren Walker accepted the Civic Inspiration Award from Ballet Hispanico with a video that starts off in typical talking head form and then transforms into a jubilant celebration of dance as he cuts loose and begins to dance through the halls of the Foundation.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/93148618"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen="""" mozallowfullscreen="""" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></p>
<p>The video shows an unexpectedly playful, joyous, and human side of one of the nonprofit sector’s most influential leaders. Does that diminish his power or the respect he’s afforded? Hardly. Just about everyone I know who’s watched the video says it has&nbsp;earned Walker admiration. He’s clearly not afraid to express his own playful side. Who doesn’t want that in a leader?&nbsp;</p>
<p>True, it’s just a video. But Larissa MacFarquhar’s 2016<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/04/what-money-can-buy-profiles-larissa-macfarquhar""> <i>New Yorker</i> article about Darren Walker and the Ford Foundation</a> paints a compelling portrait of a man not afraid to flatten hierarchy and have fun while pursuing nothing smaller than conquering inequality.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but many of the inspiring and most beloved leaders I have the good fortune to work with or meet are also game-changers and rule-breakers like Darren Walker. They are people like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, Shifra Bronznick, Barbara Dobkin, Sister Paulette LoMonaco, Rochelle Shoretz, Gloria Steinem, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Just recently, I was lucky to facilitate a meeting with staff members of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Their president, Scot Medbury, joined our discussion after we’d been exploring a few changes with significant implications for the Garden. I don’t know Scot very well, so I was curious to see how he’d respond to the ideas we’d generated before his arrival.</p>
<p>Scot immediately dove into the discussion with openness, warmth, and humor. Within minutes, he was aligned with his staff, building on their ideas and playfully exploring how far they might be stretched. His participation and attitude in the meeting was entirely additive; we lost no time building his buy-in.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I commented to one of his staff how open, agile, and collaborative I found his participation. “Scot’s one of the most friendly, engaged leaders I’ve ever worked with,” she commented, “and one of the nicest people. He brings his whole self to work.”</p>
<p>Finding your true voice as a person and becoming an authentic, integrated leader is no small task. Add to that, motivating your staff to do their best work when it might not look exactly like what you would do. But if we’re all striving to make positive contributions to the world, shouldn’t that be reflected in the way we treat each other every day, too?</p>
<p>It’s clear to me that I still have a long road ahead on my journey to be the best and most authentic leader and manager I can be. &nbsp;If you see me, please help me stay on track by sharing with me stories of the people who’ve inspired you, and join me! I could use your company.&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1","C-suite leaders in nonprofits","","","leading 501c3 organizations ","internal staff leadership","internal staff leadership","<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidspinks/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to David Spinks's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""30"">David Spinks</a>&nbsp;(Flickr)</p>

<p>More and more organizations are integrating their marketing departments with development, but what are the secrets to making the most of this collaboration? In this session, Sarah Durham, Big Duck, and Kivi Leroux-Miller, Nonprofit Marketing Guide, will explore what makes a successful communications team, and provide insight into how that success can benefit the entire organization—from producing donor-centered communications and recruiting participants to engaging your community and raising awareness. They will share findings from a nonprofit communications team success survey (<a href=""http://bit.ly/npcommteam"" target=""_blank"">TAKE THE SURVEY HERE!</a>) that explores trends in the structure and relationship of communications teams today and provide new ways for you to think about how to measure and evolve your team. Together the group will explore how to support and grow your current team, what new qualifications you might look for when making your next hire, and how to break down departmental silos and barriers.</p>

<p>Almost every organization struggles with getting new supporters—donors, members, volunteers, or others—and keeping old ones. Luckily, both problems can be solved with smart communications. This session will introduce strategies for building a brand that supporters love, so they not only engage with your organization once, but do so repeatedly and ultimately encourage others to do so. You’ll hear about ways to clearly communicate with audiences so they better understand who they are supporting and why—and so they’re more likely to come back. Drawing from real-life examples, we’ll explore how you can make supporters connect with work being done thousands of miles away using creative tools like virtual reality. We’ll also discuss how stories, images, and diverse voices can help your supporters develop deep ties to your work. Finally, we’ll touch on ways to empower your supporters to raise money for you as the ultimate brand ambassadors.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://askbigquestions.org/"" target=""_blank"">Ask Big Questions</a> recently hired dedicated communications staff. I sat down with Josh Feigelson, founder and director of Ask Big Questions, to catch up and see if he had any insights to share with other nonprofits as they set up and manage new communications teams.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" class=""alt""><strong>1. Why did you start Ask Big Questions? What was your original motivation?</strong></p>
<p class=""alt""><strong>JOSH:</strong> After six years working on campus, I came to believe that our universities do a great job of helping 18 year olds take apart their identities, but a really lousy job of helping 22 year olds put them back together. I thought we literally needed a different set of questions for our students to engage in, which would lead to different kinds of conversations than they might normally have—reflective, trust-building, soulful. So we started Ask Big Questions to bring those kinds of conversations to students and campuses across the country.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href=""/hillel-campus-community-engagement"" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Big Duck worked with you to develop the brand identity and a suite materials</a> to help you tell the campaign's story and recruit students and campus partners to participate. Looking back, what was the most valuable part of that process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOSH:</strong> Our early work getting some of the key language down was really essential and has held up. Five years later we still talk about our &nbsp;methodology of “Ask-Share-Learn-Do,” and use our tagline, “Understand others, understand yourself.” Perhaps most important was our logo and style guide, which really created a strong brand image that has helped us stand out.</p>
<p><strong>3. After several years of working together, you've fully taken the communications strategy, writing, and design in-house. What roles did you create? What’s changed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOSH:</strong> Last year we did a website redesign to reflect our new strategic plan, but we still used all the basic elements—colors, typefaces, logo—that we had from five years go, just with a more targeted purpose. The style guide has proved really versatile and adaptable. We’ve also used it for a bunch of different types of print materials, a few different email configurations, and for social media ads.</p>
<p>We hired a full-time designer who has been able to take the style guide and build new materials and products using it, including a game that we’re working on and hope to launch this fall. We’re also hiring a communications manager who will oversee our email and social media marketing, again using the basic elements that have held up so well over these last five years.</p>
<p><strong>4. Are there any challenges associated with keeping the look and feel of Ask Big Questions fresh?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOSH:</strong> I think we were both smart and lucky in that freshness and accessibility of language are core to our methodology: a Big Question is, by definition, a question that matters to everyone and that everyone can answer. So our challenges have really been more around segmenting and being smart about which audiences we’re trying to reach.</p>
<p><strong>5. It's been five years since you launched the campaign... how is it doing? What are some of the results or changes you've seen? How has your community reacted to the campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOSH:</strong> Our conversation guides were downloaded about 35,000 times over three years, and we gave away over 30,000 little blue conversation card booklets. That led us this year to re-examine our strategy, because we learned there’s demand there—we don’t, and probably shouldn’t, just give stuff away for free! This year we launched a line of three distinctive card booklets, and we’ve begun to take custom orders for schools to distribute in quantity to their students. We’ll actually be sending 5,000 booklets in Aggie maroon (Texas A &amp; M’s colors) down to Texas A&amp;M this summer! I think there’s a bright future there.</p>
<p><strong>6. What advice do you have for nonprofits who are thinking about starting new initiatives or organizations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOSH:</strong> Get really clear on your theory of change: Who are you trying to serve? What problem are you trying to solve? And does the problem you think you’re solving match the problem as they would articulate it? I think you have to be just a bit ahead of the curve—you don’t want to simply mirror back to people their own language, but you also can’t be too far in front of them either, otherwise no one will know what you’re talking about. So really take the time to listen to the folks you’re trying to serve, and get lots of feedback from them along the way.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2063%1,1408%2","How to manage your growing brand","","","managing a growing brand","growth management interview brand","growth management interview brand ask big questions","",

Any nonprofit marketer or fundraiser reading this blog is well aware of what happens every time a new app, social network, video, or <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=sad+jordan&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUusXy15bOAhUMaD4KHeY3BLsQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1105&amp;bih=543"" target=""_blank"">retired athlete in distress</a> explodes on the internet.</p>
<p>Basically, everyone goes crazy.</p>
<p>Okay, so Pokémon GO might be one of those rare cases when a new viral phenomenon actually is worth your time--people are <a href=""https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-usage-data"" target=""_blank"">spending more time</a> in the mobile game than any social networking app and it already <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-tops-twitters-daily-users-sees-more-engagement-than-facebook/"" target=""_blank"">has more daily users than Twitter</a>. Plus, there is a convincing argument for <a href=""http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-power-of-unsaturated-marketing-channels#sm.00000v2pbtq5uzdchunkx2igzd71g"" target=""_blank"">testing new channels before they’re saturated</a>.</p>
<p>But let’s not lose our heads here. Again, it’s 2016. It’s been awhile since nonprofits scrambled to make a mark in Myspace and someone figured out how to put <a href=""https://memecrunch.com/meme/SG50/give-that-man-a-cookie"">blocky white text over a photo</a>. We should know better.</p>
<p>New media isn’t new any more. Even talking about new media, a term Google defines as a “means of mass communication using digital technologies such as the Internet,” makes me feel like a bit of a grandpa. By now, Facebook, Twitter, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and other….ahem...platforms for mass communication using digital technologies, have clearly established themselves as big winners in the <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/08/12/attention-economy/"" target=""_blank"">attention economy</a>.</p>
<p>With a limited PR or advertising budget, you would review the reach and demographic data that publications make readily available, not to mention the data you may have collected from past efforts, to make sure you are getting the biggest bang for your buck. New media has been around for long enough that there is now plenty of solid data out there to help guide your strategy. You can find pretty much any data available for traditional media, plus things like average clickthrough rates and cost-per-click (CPC) vs. cost-per-impression (CPM). &nbsp;So whether you’re working with a five-figure marketing budget or a two-person team, there’s no reason to let excitement about the latest trend distract you from making informed decisions based on real data and best practices.</p>
<p>Of course, more nonprofits are closer to the two-person team side of the spectrum, and as organizations add staff they often ratchet up responsibilities so that expanded teams are quickly as strapped as they were before new positions were added. Getting caught up in the excitement of shiny new platforms can easily derail these organizations, leading to fragmented and ad hoc marketing strategies that don’t make positive impressions or gather promising leads.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t ever adopt the position of never testing new marketing channels -- and plenty of interesting <a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog/2016/07/12/use-the-power-of-pokemon-go-for-good-and-have-some-fun/"" target=""_blank"">nonprofit uses of Pokémon GO</a> have been gathered, from quick newsjacking techniques to more robust campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the time has definitively come to approach digital marketing with the same level of rigor as you would with more traditional media. It takes time and resources to do anything right, so if your overloaded department is getting tempted, or pushed, to take advantage of a new big thing, remember that slow and steady (and <a href=""http://www.accidentalcreative.com/productivity/slow-and-steady-does-not-win-the-race/"" target=""_blank"">deliberate</a>) often does win the race.</p>

<p>What we're going to cover today are both trends that are out there, both digitally and offline, in the nonprofit arena that are effecting year-end fundraising campaigns, as well as some tactics that we saw becoming more and more common over the past couple years. First of all, why are we here? Why are you taking time in the middle of summer to talk about year-end fundraising? The answer to that is fairly obvious. You're here because you know how important year-end fundraising is. As this <a href=""http://www.networkforgood.com/digitalgivingindex/"" target=""_blank"">data from Network for Good</a> shows, a very significant amount of individual charitable donations come in at the end of the year, and while this data here is specifically for online giving, we do know that offline giving through the mail follows similar patterns as well.<br /> <br />Moving to a few broader trends to keep in mind when developing year-end strategy. First of all, <a href=""http://npengage.com/nonprofit-fundraising/mobile-donations-up-45-in-2015-giving-season-infographic/"" target=""_blank"">mobile giving and mobile web traffic have made significant jumps in 2015</a>. It's something that you've been hearing about for a long time, surely, and now is officially, well really probably every year for the past five years were officially the time adopt good mobile practices. Online giving has now caught up to e-commerce, which is always a good place to look for when you really have to make the shift to a new technology because the nonprofit world tends to lag behind the offline for-profit world for quite a bit of time when new technologies and digital practics are introduced. Just for a point of comparison, currently 15% of website sales happen on mobile devices and we've now reached 14% of donations in 2015. While 45% of online giving was mobile in 2015, 52% of e-commerce site traffic is on mobile. Non-profits still have a bit of catch-up to do there.<br /> <br />Also, more and more nonprofits have come onboard with running sophisticated multi-channel campaigns, making sure to utilize every channel at their disposal to support the overall goal. For example, your direct mail program should no longer use separate branding and messaging than your online campaign. You want to have branded campaigns, at least with consistent messaging across all channels. You also want to make sure that you're using channels strategically to support each other so when you have an email go out, you should be sending and posting Facebook and Twitter messages on the same dates for that message, and making sure that you're getting all the campaign messaging you need present on your website so that when someone sees an email, a direct mail piece, and goes to Google you later, they immediately recognize the message in the ask.<br /> <br />Further, this one is a little more of a granular trend, but something that I think is very interesting: emails are getting sent later in the day. This trend has been increasing for a while now, but again, it's something that saw a jump in 2015. The majority of emails are still being sent between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m., but more and more emails are getting sent later in the afternoon, which is when the majority of online donations are made. That's just an interesting trend to note. I myself haven't necessarily observed significant differences in results between emails sent in the morning and in the afternoon, but knowing that fewer emails are sent in the afternoon may mean that you're getting more market share at that time.<br /> <br />Also, the time has come to make sure you are maximizing your <a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/"" target=""_blank"">Giving Tuesday</a> contributions. For Big Duck's clients, it has come to be typical that a day-by-day breakdown of online gifts in December shows two clear jumps in giving<em>—</em>on the 31st and on Giving Tuesday. In 2015, overall, it was reported that nearly $117 million was raised on Giving Tuesday through more than 1 million gifts.<br /> <br />Now for some specific tactics that you might use. We're highlighting some of these tactics&nbsp;as interesting, fairly new things that we haven't seen a lot of, but have been increasing. Some of them are tactics that are becoming very, very widespread. The first is the use of emojis. This is something that is an observation that came from Steve MacLaughlin, the director of analytics at Blackbaud. Every year he does analysis of hundreds of emails subject lines. I believe that he analyzed 450 subject lines this last year, and while it wasn't an overwhelming trend, there was definitely an uptick in the use of emojis. One thing that he noted is that he hasn't done testing specifically on whether emojis increase open rates or not. It is certainly something you want to test, but there is a concern that it could become so widespread that it would lose its effectiveness, though I certainly haven't observed that happening since the year-end season. This is a tactic definitely to consider testing over the year if you're able to, and giving a shot during year-end as well.<br /> <br />Also, another thing here is a very significant increase in the use of personalized email subject lines that pull in a first name. You can see that in the top subject line here, ""Take in the views, Steve."" This is something that, anecdotally a lot of people have noticed an increased open rates with. That's another good thing to test, as well.<br /> <br />Also, lightboxes. Lightboxes, in case anyone is not familiar with what a lightbox is, sometimes they're called mobile windows, they used to be called homepage hijacks, it is basically when you go to a website and the page that you land on grays out and another window pops up and hovers over that screen. If that still doesn't ring a bell, if you ever go to Facebook and click on a photo that someone's posted of you, you're familiar with how that photo rises up and the rest of the screen grays out.That's a lightbox. For fundraising campaigns, it's increasingly become best practice, and it has become a lot more widespread to include an on-load lightbox, maining a lightbox that will automatically load when someone lands on your homepage or throughout your site or on the most popular pages. Lightboxes have been shown pretty consistently to be among the top fundraising components of fundraising campaigns. Generally online, the top component is is going to remain being email, but lightboxes are generally the next below that. For that reason, you're seeing a lot of investment in lightboxes.<br /> <br />As the <a href=""/wildlife-organization-fundraising"">lightbox from Conservation International</a> on the top left highlights, it's a good idea to make sure you have a lightbox for every single major fundraising campaign that you run. Conservation International had a lightbox both for their Giving Tuesday match and for the rest of their year-end fundraising campaign. Also, a number of tactics have been employed in the past few years to really make lightboxes more eye-catching and more user friendly. What you see here on the bottom left and top right are Nature Conservacy and ACLU lightboxes that use animation. For the ACLU, what would have happened in this light box when it loaded is that the gold bar would have started at zero and then the bar would have increased to the right. You will often see that, also, with dollar amounts increasing to what's been raised up to the minute or the last time the light box was able to refresh its data.&nbsp;On the bottom left what you have is we have a clock counting down to the last second of the last day of the year. Also increasingly common is placing a gift string on the lightbox itself. The way that that works is the amount that the person selects gets transferred over to the donation form that they go to after clicking Give Now or Donate Now.</p>
<p><br />This is something I want to hammer on just a little bit more because while it has become a lot more widespread, I was very surprised to see how few nonprofits were using lightboxes past year-end. That's simply because of what I said earlier: it is a real driver of giving. If canonly make one improvement to your year-end strategy this coming year, I would invest in a lightbox. Something else, another twist on the lightbox that I've seen a bit more these last couple years, though it's stil pretty rare, is a pull-out lightbox, for lack of a better word. A pull-out screen with a donation form. It works the same way that a lightbox does except when you land on Planned Parenthood's page during a fundraising campaign, this donation form will slide out from the right and then, as you can see with that Make Your Gift tab, which is written vertically, you can click the tab to move it back to the side of the screen, and it remains there so you can click to open it again throughout your visit to the site.<br /> <br />We also saw that on BAM's website this past year, and two years ago, I saw it on Heifer International's site during year-end. Heifer did a pull-down menu that scrolled down from the top of the page and covered nearly two-thirds of the page. Now, they didn't repeat that tactic this year, which I found interesting because I don't have any data on how these pull-outs do, but I cannot imagine that they did not raise a significant amount of money.<br /> <br />This is another tactic that was very widespread this year that I saw on a significant percentage of the sites that I checked out, and that is that very thin top-of-site banner that you see here on a screenshot from Amnesty International. The way that it's done here is very well done, it's very eye-catching while still being very much in line with Amnesty's brand, using that red, the yellow, and the white. Most of the top-of-site banners that I observed remained on the site no matter where you went. Throughout the entire site, every page you would see this banner. Many of them also were sticky, meaning that they stayed on the top of the screen when you scrolled down, so it was always present no matter what you did throughout the sites.<br /> <br />Something that we've started to see a little bit more, this is another one that's kind of more slowly increasing, but I certainly noticed it in a number of more sites this past year, was a complete homepage takeover. What you see on the right is an example from International Rescue Committee in which they basically reskinned the homepage of the site with something that kind of looks like a lightbox. That's an interesting take on something people are maybe a bit more familiar seeing because lightboxes are more common, but they really just made it their homepage. What you have on the left is WWF's homepage.Their primary navigation is still available, but they reskinned the entire page to be a fundraising ask. Charity:water used this tactic as well in 2015.&nbsp;I find this tactic very interesting because it provides the opportunity to get at people from different angles. Those people who aren't going to necessarily click to give right away, those people are going to click out of the light box, if they scroll or look down, they're going to see another message reinforcing that fundraising ask, and again, below that, yet another message making the argument for donating in a different way by emphasizing the percentage of your gift that would go to programs.</p>
<p>One other thing to note: while the example on the left, WWF, keeps, I believe, most of the primary navigation in place, on the right, the primary navigation is virtually gone. But you do see that they included a bring me to the IRC homepage link on the top left. While I tend to recommend very aggressive fundraising tactics at the end of the year, you do want to make sure that you're keeping an eye towards not being overly aggravating to people who are not going to give in that moment, or even that year. You want to make sure that you have a way for someone to get at the content that they want to get at and maybe consider, at least hopefully, donating later.<br /> <br />That is the end of the presentation. I went through it fairly quickly, and we have plenty of time left over for questions. If anyone has questions I am all ears.<br /> <br />Okay. I have one question sent to me from the moderator: What should I be doing right now to get ready? At Big Duck, we start with conceptualizing what the theme or the concept of a campaign is going to be before we start digging into any tactics. That's always a very good place to start, by making sure that you take the time to think about what we know right now about our community and about our issue. What can we see from the data about how people responded to different messages in the past? Or what do we know about any upcoming events that may influence our campaign or issues that are the community is paying close attention to right now? By asking yourself those questions you will be able to find a main subject or theme for your campaign that will resonate with your community.<br /> <br />I also have a question now from Caralie. The question is: When is a good time to plan for Giving Tuesday? My answer to that is as early as possible is pretty much always the answer that I would give for when is a good time to plan for any fundraising campaign. One of the reasons why we did decide to put on this webinar over the summer is because it is a slower season for many nonprofits. Now, I know it's becoming more and more common that there is no slow season. Still, summer is probably the slowest you have. If you're able to carve out any time before September, I would recommend that you block out some time to at least review data from past campaigns and think about what issues out there might be effecting your community so you can start putting together the roadmap for your Giving Tuesday and year-end campaign.<br /> <br />I also have a question from Bridget, that is: Are there any paid platforms or tools to add a lightbox to our site? That's a good question. I am not aware of any specific platforms and tools that would be universally useful for a large number of people. It really depends on the specific platform that your site is on and the capabilities of that platform. Though I haven't come across this myself, there may even be platforms that make lightboxes a bit more automated. I'm sure that kind of thing does exist. The first thing I would recommend doing is reaching out to your contact at the company that manages your website platform and seeign what options might be available. If you don't have web development skills or resources in your organization, most likely you're going to find that you need to reach out to a third-party developer to produce a lightbox and implement it for you. However, in many, if not most cases, the platform you use for online donation processing or for your website will be able to do that for you.<br /> <br />I have a question from Jeff. The question is: Is it still a best practice to show a lot of copy on direct mail envelopes? I remember when matching gifts and deadlines were pretty much always announced on the envelope, but I feel like maybe I'm seeing that less. That's something that I certainly still see a lot. In my experience, and I think most fundraisers would agree with me, a matching gift specifically, is hands down going to be the best driver for fundraising that there is. Knowing that your gift could be doubled or even tripled really does a lot to drive donating. If you do have a matching gift, putting that on an envelope is certainly not a bad idea. However, it's commonly the case that more simple packages often do better. Sometimes the reverse is also true. As much as you can test, I would certainly test, but if you need to cut costs, you going with a plain envelope is not a bad idea.<br /> <br />I have a question from Sarah, who says: I have a really small team and we've got seriously limited resources, is there one thing we absolutely have to do this year-end? The answer to that is kind of dependent on what your campaign was like the year before. If you can only add one thing, then you want to add the next thing building on what ws done last year. We do still see non-profits who are only doing offline fundraising at year-end, so if you're only doing direct mail, the one thing you should do would be to send three to five emails and just keep in mind, I would actually recommend you send closer to nine this year, given trends in the number of year-end emails that get sent, and just simply how the dates fall this year, with both New Years and Christmas falling on weekends. If you have likean offline and some kind of online campaign, I would say that the best new thing to do would be adding a lightbox.<br /> <br />A question from Heather: What do you think about giving a gift with the ask, address labels, note pads, et cetera? That's something I'm going to say personally I haven't tested that kind of package myself. I know that it is something that does often work very well for nonprofits, but it's also the kind of thing that I've also heard, anecdotally, of a lot of nonprofits have moved away from. It's definitely something that you want to try and test, though, because as is obvious, it does add costs. Now, those costs for many nonprofits are worth the return on investments, so it's something you want to think about in terms of the cost. I would look at other nonprofits in your vertical. If you're an environmental organization, see if you can get your hands on direct mail packages from other environmental organizations to see what the trends in your vertical are. If you're not able to test, that is a fine way to make your decision.<br /> <br />Okay. That seems to be our last questions. Of course, if anyone has a question before I do hang up, just pop it over. Moving on, we have a small favor to ask of you guys. <a href=""http://bit.ly/npcommteam"">Big Duck, in partnership with Kivi Leroux Miller's Nonprofit Marketing Guide is conducting a survey to learn what makes nonprofits communications teams successful</a>. This is something that both ourselves and Kivi Leroux Miller are very interested in trying to figure out what can be done in terms of staff structure or the way that communications teams work to improve efficiency and success. A <a href=""http://bit.ly/npcommteam"">link to this survey</a> will be emailed to you. I believe that it is just about a 10-minute survey, but details on that will be included when you click the link from the email, so if anyone is able to fill that out, we are, of course, very grateful.<br /> <br />We have also gone ahead and compiled some additional resources relevant to year-end fundraising campaigns. This deck will be sent to you as well, so you don't have to furiously write down all of these resources. Of course, the first is that Big Duck is a resource that is here for you. We, on September 16, have a day-long, <a href=""/multichannel-fundraising-bootcamp%20"">immersive workshop on planning your year-end fundraising campaign</a>. For, like one of you mentioned having a very small team, this is a way that you can really get a lot done in planning and strategizing, and even developing a theme for your campaign in a single day at a relatively low investment point. That's something, definitely, to check out.<br /> <br />We also have some availability still for actually producing the strategy and implementing a year-end campaign, so if you're interested in having Big Duck produce and run and even analyze your campaign, please reach out to our VP, Farra Trompeter, who I'm sure at least half of you know personally. Her email, <a href=""mailto:farra@bigducknyc.com"">farra@bigducknyc.com</a> is at the bottom of the slide here.<br /> <br />We do also want to refer to you the Big Duck blog. We have a lot of great posts on year-end fundraising, and of course, there are tons of great additional blogs and resources out there if you Google year-end fundraising best practices I'm sure you will find. Thank you for taking time out of your busy days and I hope that all of you have found something that you want to consider implementing in your 2016 year-end campaign.

<p>Nonprofits get a significant number of their donations from individuals at the end of the year. Online, 29% of individual gifts come in December, and a similarly large percentage of offline giving tends to come at the end of the year as well.</p>
<p>Between reviewing past campaign performance, making sure you know what’s going on in your community, thinking through the channels you have at your disposal, balancing that budget, and (fingers crossed) securing matching gifts, taking full advantage of the season takes some work. So don’t wait too long to begin planning for a multichannel campaign that will reach your donors and inspire them to make a gift.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">When raising awareness recruits people into programs</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">Before embarking on a successful awareness campaign, the smartest organizations note their starting point and define their objectives, in quantitative terms if possible. This is often most manageable for organizations that are trying to raise awareness to attract and recruit program participants or members.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" class=""alt"">Some organizations can define their target market in their area – for instance, how many people are affected by heart disease in America, or how many homeless people live in New York City. They can also measure how many of those people they currently serve in existing programs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Consider writing a brief such as: “Our target market for Program Y is _________. We are currently reaching and engaging ____ &nbsp;per year, or __% of this market. Our objective is to reach ________ by ___________(specific date), and/or achieve growth at a rate of __________% over the next ___ years.” Doing this will help you get clear where you’re starting from and where you’re heading in specific, measurable terms. Be sure to use numbers you can realistically track and update along the way.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">When raising awareness educates and changes behavior</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Changing behavior or perceptions around an issue begins with awareness, for example, that using condoms can reduce your risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases, or shaking your baby can have damaging long-term effects.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Raising awareness to change hearts and minds doesn’t necessarily raise awareness for your organization. Rather, it focuses on the behavioral impact you want to have on society at large.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The same type of brief described above can work here, too, although measuring it may be harder. Your nonprofit will likely have to conduct public opinion surveys or poll repeatedly to see if the audiences you want to reach are becoming more educated and/or changing their behaviors over time.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>When raising awareness grows revenue</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Too many organizations aspire to become a household name to boost their fundraising. While the idea sounds good, the investment required to get there makes this highly improbable for most organizations.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A campaign to become better-known as a first step towards raising money is, well, just a first step. To move the people who are now ‘aware’ to the ‘supporter’ level on your ladder of engagement, you’ll have to launch additional campaigns: direct mail, for example, or other ‘asks’ requiring additional time and money. You’ll also have to give them actions to take beyond inputting their credit card number into your website so they feel connected, and not like an ATM machine.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When the goal is to identify and attract new donors, consider defining the persona of the person you hope to attract as a starting point. You might write a brief such as, “We currently have ___ donors who are between the ages of X and Y giving annually at an average gift of ____. They support our organization because Z (motivation) and want to know that we are (results). Our goal is to grow this segment of our donor base by XX% by (date).” Breaking down the general public into more practical segments you can tackle is also key. (</span><a href=""/hello-general-public"" target=""_blank""><span>For more on that, read this great blog by Elizabeth Ricca.</span></a><span>)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Setting objectives around donors is harder if you’re not sure how big the market is. Consider informing your brief with any data you’ve gathered over many years and industry data from sources like the </span><a href=""http://www.afpnet.org/ResourceCenter/?navItemNumber=502""><span>Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP</span><span>)’s resource exchange</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Unless your donor retention numbers are above average, consider boosting your base of fundraising support with a donor retention campaign before you launch new awareness-raising campaigns. </span><span>After all, only 19% of first-time donors (who are higher up the ladder of engagement) are likely to give again</span><span>. But if they do, you’re much more likely to keep them. That’s low-hanging fruit.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>And while you’re at it, please get real about research</span></h3>
<p>Too few organizations spend time and money on research. Many see it as an unnecessary investment or are, perhaps, daunted by it. Those that take the time to conduct research thoughtfully usually become converts; even the smallest amount of research can have a profound positive impact on a campaign by shaping it to be much more specifically useful.</p>
<p>When possible, we use qualitative research, such as interviews, to get to know a target audience better and craft messages that truly resonate. Quantitative research, such as national or local omnibus surveys or <a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank"">Big Duck’s Brandraising Benchmark</a> (which helps you measure if specific audiences are familiar with your organization, trust it, and are likely to donate) can help you get more statistically valid data.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Don’t assume you have to spend months or all of your budget to gather useful data. Research can be done formally or informally, deeply or lightly, by your organization or by specialists. At a minimum, add a ‘conduct research’ phase to the plan for your campaign, and then leverage whatever you can to do it well. Anything will be better than nothing.</span></span></span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Leverage your brand</span></h3>
<p><span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-2ce31ea1-79ed-5c7f-a975-9b4947b406a1""><span>Last but not least, remember that although campaigns usually target very specific audiences, they are still an opportunity to engage people more deeply with your organization. Developing campaigns that feel “on brand” can help people connect the dots faster.</span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>With 8 million prospective donors in New York City alone giving more to charity each year, it seems like nonprofits shouldn’t have a problem fundraising from individuals. But if you’re feeling disgruntled that your nonprofit didn’t receive a fraction of that total, remember that our great&nbsp;city is also&nbsp;home to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nycedc.com/system/files/files/industry/NonprofitRoundtableReport_June2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">35,000 nonprofits</a>, and that New York State <a href=""http://www.nycon.org/files/7814/2653/2398/Palm_Card_Template_2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"">has close to 98,000</a>&nbsp;organizations that&nbsp;all&nbsp;feel an urgency to get a slice of New York’s great philanthropic pie.</p>
<p>The competition for nonprofits to stand out and engage people is palpable. Between ads, social media, email, volunteer canvassers on the street, good ol’ fashioned snail mail and even forms of gaming like&nbsp;<a href=""/think-before-you-go"" target=""_blank"">Pokémon GO</a>, it’s nearly impossible for New Yorkers to go a single day without being asked to sign a petition, volunteer, or donate.</p>
<p>Good thing nonprofits are increasingly integrating the concept of the&nbsp;<a href=""/moving-audience-up-your-ladder-of-engagement"" target=""_blank"">ladder of engagement&nbsp;</a>into their fundraising and communications strategies—the simple idea that an organization will be more successful at gaining (and keeping!) new supporters if you ask them to engage in quick and easy ways before asking them to take bigger and more meaningful actions over time. The first step on the ladder is basic awareness—getting yourself on the radar screens of people who haven’t heard of you before. After all, can you really expect someone to donate to your organization if they haven’t even heard of you?</p>
<p>A missing piece in the effort to be better known is market research: gathering information and data about target markets or customers. This is part of the DNA of corporate business practice, but it’s often underutilized with nonprofits because of budgets or lack of clarity on how to do it well.</p>
<p>In 2016, Big Duck launched the&nbsp;<a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising Benchmark</a>&nbsp;to measure awareness and perceptions about nonprofit brands among a national audience. By doing research for several nonprofits at once, we’ve figured out how to keep it affordable and provide useful comparative data too. This fall, we’ll be launching the first-ever&nbsp;<a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank"">New York City Benchmark</a>, specifically designed to measure awareness and affinity of nonprofits by New Yorkers. The Benchmark will tell you if New Yorkers have heard of your nonprofit, what they think of you, and whether they’d be likely to donate in the future—all useful indicators to give you a sense of where you stand in the minds of New York’s individual donors. By repeating the Benchmark over time, you’ll be able to measure if your outreach, awareness, and brand-building efforts are really moving the needle.</p>

<p><strong>Of those 21,000 engagements in the pre-ask stewardship campaign, do you have an estimate of how many were current vs. prospective donors?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Michael:</em> Based on the number of number of new emails collected and new social media followers, we believe that about 75% were from non-donors. However, this wasn’t something that we tracked closely at the time. In an ideal situation I would have paid more attention to and found a way to follow up on this engagement. We have a tool called <a href=""https://attentive.ly/"" target=""_blank"">Attentive.ly</a>, which Blackbaud recently acquired, that is a great social listening and response tool. We just didn’t have the bandwidth to apply it during the busy season.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of engagement did the Thanksgiving email get? You said 'it got great engagement'--can you go into detail on what happened?</strong></p>
<p><em>Michael:</em> While normally we measure the success of our emails on a number of metrics, in this case I meant that the open rate was very good. Among active donors, the open rate was 30%, which is up to 5 points above average for a non-fundraising email. Among lapsed donors and non-donors, the open rates were 15.7% and 11% respectively which is slightly above average for lapsed donors and average for donors.</p>
<p><strong>Who did you target with your Facebook ads? Was it a lookalike audience, your donor file, or your prospect file?</strong></p>
<p><em>Michael:</em> We targeted a number of groups. Uploaded email lists of both donors and prospects, lookalikes, Facebook followers, and people that follow similar organizations. The uploaded lists and Facebook followers led to a far better conversion at about .35% clickthrough rate. Depending on your organization and current online investments, I would look more at paid search than paid social, but if you have some budget to invest in social, I think it is worth it to test.</p>
<p><strong>It looked like there were two different mail packages. Was one a remail or did different audiences get a different package?</strong></p>
<p><em>Michael:</em> Just one package (<a href=""/wildlife-organization-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">see it here</a>). The letter and donation form had some variable text based on a number of donor segments. Many organizations do have success with multiple packages or remails, but as a conservation organization we are very careful with our footprint when it comes to printing and mailing.</p>
<p><strong>Would you describe your 6 year-end appeals and the timing in more detail?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Michael:</em> Just to clarify, the “6 year-end appeals” were all emails and didn’t include mail, social, or other channels. The year-end emails started on December 12, which was the final day of the Paris Climate Conference, and this email announced the results of the conference with a big “thank you” to supporters and a hard-ask for donations because “now is the time to act.” From there, we sent three emails from the 17th to the 28th that each covered an area of focus of our work— oceans, forests, and wildlife—and also announced the matching gift from our Board member Harrison Ford. That left two more emails for the last few days of the year that were very simple. They reminded people of the matching gift opportunity and the important role the donor plays, and were heavy on tax-deductibility language. The timing of each email aligned with major events happening related to the Climate conference, fit the best practices our organization has tested, or followed recommendations made by our team at Big Duck.</p>
<p><strong>In your cost per dollar raised, did you factor in staff time/creative time, and the consultant? Or was that hard costs only? Would love to know how to best calculate this to make it a selling point to management.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Michael:</em> Really good and important question. Generally speaking, when measuring the efficacy of a fundraising campaign or appeal, I do not include staff time or salary (this is different when measuring the program as a whole). However, when calculating the cost to raise a dollar (CTRD) for this campaign, the expenses included Big Duck’s fees as our consultant, printing, mailhouse services, postage, and online ad costs. Selling this to an executive or manager can be difficult. I have almost always found that bringing in a consultant makes convincing management easier, but it is case by case. I’m happy to talk more about this.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> To calculate the cost to raise a dollar for your campaign, divide the total expenses by total revenue generated. For example, if your year-end fundraising campaign generated $60,000, and you spent $15,000, your cost to raise a dollar would be $0.25. Typically, organizations include hard costs in the expenses, and don’t pull out staff salaries as those are considered sunk costs. <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-measuring-fundraising-performance#sm.0000kqv064qrtcpdqan1kippze47r"" target=""_blank"">Here’s a helpful article with more information on this important metric and determining return on investment (ROI).</a></p>
<p><strong>Did you do anything special at Conservation International to thank first-time donors?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Michael:</em> Yes! First off, we do a lot to thank all of our donors including sending a handwritten “thank you” postcard immediately when we receive the gift. For new donors, we contact them by phone or email at the end of every month as a quick thank you. New donors at higher levels get a more immediate and personal touch with information about our work and the impact of their gift.</p>
<p><strong>What are some good examples of engagement activities?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> You can include engagement activities on social media, via email and on your website. It could be as simple as a “tell us what you think about our newsletter” to a campaign with a quiz or pledge component. On social it gets even easier, people love video, pictures and quizzes. The most important thing to think about is two fold: will it appeal to your audience and does it make sense for the mission? If the answer is yes to both, then go for it.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> I agree with all that Danielle said here, and would add a few more questions for you to ask: 1) does the action feel meaningful to the donor or prospect? 2) is it related to the theme of your campaign? and 3) is it easy to do?</p>
<p><strong>How did you solicit donors to offer matching gifts?</strong></p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> First, I would try to identify who your most engaged major donors are. Depending on your organization, that might start at the $5,000 level and for others it might be at or above $100,000. Then look for donors who are the most engaged—they’ve given for several years, they attend your events, they have a personal relationship with the executive director, board member, or other staff, they are actively involved as volunteers or board members, etc. Once you have a sense of the amount you’d like to set for your matching gift amount, ask one or several of your most engaged matching donors if they would like to make a gift you could use for as a match for the campaign OR if they would be open to allocating their recent or next gift. Some donors are even game to be part of your campaign—sharing why they gave and authoring one of your appeal emails or letters.</p>
<p><strong>How do you engage your monthly donors in your year-end efforts?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> Monthly donors should get a different set of messages in December that acknowledge and thank them for their ongoing support. You want to highlight examples of the impact of their sustaining gifts first and then make the ask for an additional donation at the end of the year. If you have a prominent monthly donor who would agree to make the ask for the campaign, that would be more powerful than say the CEO or Executive Director. Your campaign spokesperson should be the right person for the ask, it doesn’t have to be leadership.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> Generally, I think year-end is a great time to cultivate your monthly donors-—a time to show your appreciation and give them a special report about how they’ve made a difference this past year. You could also use the end of the year as a chance to run a special sustainer upgrade campaign. To do this, you’d need to segment your monthly donors out and then send them mail or email appeals that ask them to increase their monthly giving amount for the next year by 25%, or 50%, or 100% using dollar amounts based on their current contribution level. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On your list of bonus ideas, you suggested that we ask board, staff and volunteers to make phone calls. Would the purpose of those calls be to solicit gifts or to thank donors?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> When I worked at the American Red Cross and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs we planned thank-a-thons in early November to lay the foundation for our year-end fundraising campaign. Our Board worked the thank-a-thon, calling major donors, and our staff handled mid-level donors. We also selected key donors for handwritten Thanksgiving or holiday notes from leadership, while development staff sent Thanksgiving cards to key community partners, volunteers, and mid-level corporate and individual supporters.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> Yes, the main suggestion was to use the phone as a channel for acknowledging donors, ideally before or around Thanksgiving. There are some nonprofits that incorporated telemarketing or telefundraising into their campaigns, with calls to prospects, current donors, or lapsed donors made before or after a mail piece or key email arrives. Other nonprofits use SMS or texting to educate or solicit donors at year-end as well.</p>
<p><strong>What is a lightbox and what is a homepage takeover?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> Here is the definition from DigitalMarketing-Glossary.com: “In digital marketing, the lighbox term is often used for referring to the lightbox pop-ups used to promote content or offers on a web page.” I’ve seen nonprofits use this tactic to ask people to subscribe to ecommunications, change a one-time gift to a monthly gift on a donation form and ask for website visitor reviews. A smart tactic at year-end is to add a lightbox pop-up on the homepage promoting the campaign with a story and then linking over to the donation form.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> We generally recommend using a lightbox for one-two weeks in December and ideally coding it so that the amount the donor clicks or fills in transfers over to the corresponding donation form. <a href=""/2015-year-end-campaigns-findings"" target=""_blank"">You can see an example of a lightbox we set up for Fountain House—and read about how well it did—in this post.</a> Some people use the phrases homepage takeover and lightbox interchangeably for nonprofit websites, though homepage takeover technically refers to the instances when one advertiser takes over all advertising spots on a website.</p>
<p><strong>When is #GivingTuesday this year?</strong></p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> #GivingTuesday is always the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving, following the consumer-focused holidays of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. You can learn more about this global day of giving at <a href=""https://www.givingtuesday.org/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.givingtuesday.org/</a>. If you are looking for some great ideas for how you can celebrate #GivingTuesday, <a href=""/raising-money-givingtuesday-tactics"" target=""_blank"">read this blog post from one of our strategists, highlighting 2015 trends.</a></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> This year #GivingTuesday is the earliest it’s ever been since its first year in 2012— November 29! That means that soliciting for social ambassadors, developing content and coming up with the promotions before the big day needs to start now. Two years ago, I attended <a href=""https://www.nten.org/ntc/"" target=""_blank"">NTEN’s Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC)</a> and I heard that organizations should treat and plan for #GivingTuesday like a special event. Coordinate your activities, your people and your content months ahead of time to run a seamless event. <a href=""https://twitter.com/blackbaud"" target=""_blank"">Stay tuned to @Blackbaud</a> for announcements about our #GivingTuesday webinar series starting up in September.</p>
<p><strong>If a gift was given on #GivingTuesday, would you ask that donor again in December?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> I think it’s fine to solicit for a second gift because research shows that #GivingTuesday donors consider those donations like event gifts, not associated with their regular year-end donation. That being said, you shouldn’t re-solicit unless you sent an additional thank you message in addition to the donation autoresponder. You have to thank the donor again before making another appeal. In that appeal you should also thank them again for their #GivingTuesday donation and demonstrate that you’re paying attention and know they already gave—this is a really important step. If you’re just not comfortable re-soliciting donors then I recommend suppressing them from all year-end appeal messages, and instead sending them a happy holidays greeting and a welcome series.</p>
<p><strong>What are some things smaller nonprofits can do for #GivingTuesday?</strong></p>
<p><em>Danielle:</em> I don’t think the size of the organization matters on #GivingTuesday. A smaller organization can still send a #GivingTuesday appeal and make the pitch on their website and social media. Leading up to #GivingTuesday, post mission moments on social (make sure the content is sharable and bite size), highlighting the impact of the organization’s work and get a promotional image and a testimonial up on your website too.</p>
<p><em>Farra:</em> If you’ve never done anything for #GivingTuesday before, start small. Just send an email that morning and/or post an ask on your single most popular social media channel. You can also ask your supporters to give something other than money—their time, their network (sharing a message or image), or their action. Some organizations use it a day for them to give back—with their staff or board volunteering for another organization or sending a message of thanks to donors and program participants alike.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span></span><span>Which candidate do you </span><span>trust</span><span> to be President of the United States? This is the central question of the campaign. Thinking about trust—both how to build it and how to break it—can also teach nonprofits a lot about building relationships with supporters. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a nonprofit communicator or fundraiser, you know trust is crucial. </span><span>Your nonprofit's donors must trust you to put their money to work in the way that does the most good for a cause that's important to them</span><span>. For supporters to keep giving year over year and at higher and higher amounts, that trust cannot waver. It must grow stronger. There’s a ton of research out there about the importance of trust in the nonprofit sector, including work by </span><a href=""http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/33/2/185.full.pdf"" target=""_blank""><span>U.K. Professor Adrian Sargeant,</span></a><span> who analyzes why individuals must perceive a nonprofit as trustworthy as a precursor to giving, and the need to continuously and intentionally foster trust when fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you know your organization is doing great work, being seen as trustworthy by potential donors should not be considered a given. Take into account </span><a href=""https://www.philanthropy.com/article/1-in-3-Americans-Lacks-Faith/233613"" target=""_blank""><span>The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s 2015 research</span></a><span> into Americans’ confidence in charities. While the study found that more than 80 percent of people said charities do a “very good” or “somewhat good” job helping people (good news!), over a third said they “had little” or “no confidence” in charities, and a third said charities do a ""not too good"" or ""not at all good"" job spending money wisely. Over 40 percent said their leaders are paid too much. Just like our presidential nominees, the nonprofit sector has a serious trust problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are </span><span>four actionable lessons about building trust with donors from this election season.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lesson #1: Be original.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Strive to use authentic, unique, and differentiating language when communicating to your donors and supporters. Remember when parts of Melania Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention in July was clearly lifted from Michelle Obama’s </span><span>Democratic National Convention from 2008? (If you missed it you can watch a side-by-side comparison video on </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcbiGsDMmCM"" target=""_blank""><span>Youtube</span></a><span>.) So even if the tagline or mission statement of another organization captures perfectly what you’ve long sought to express, take a cue from Melania and find another way to say it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lesson #2: Be transparent.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Be upfront and open about your financials, and communicate clearly and regularly about how you’re spending donor dollars. Clinton finally </span><a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/14/paul-manafort/paul-manafort-says-clintons-tax-returns-show-incom/"" target=""_blank""><span>released her 2015 tax returns</span></a><span> after months of deferring the request. But as of mid-August, Trump’s still refusing, and his persistent avoidance is drawing a</span><a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/the-great-trump-tax-mysteries"" target=""_blank""><span> whole lot of attention and speculation</span></a><span>. Take the high road and </span><span>keep your 990s available on your website and </span><span>make sure your listings on websites like </span><a href=""http://www.guidestar.org/Home.aspx"" target=""_blank""><span>Guidestar</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://www.charitynavigator.org/"" target=""_blank""><span>Charity Navigator</span></a><span> are up to date and accurate. </span></p>
<p><strong>Lesson #3: Be consistent.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Everyone should be given room to evolve their views, but acting on consistent values and beliefs and staying true to your mission help build trust and credibility. The “flip-floppery” of Donald Trump has been unprecedented—from his views on abortion, health care, and even his own feelings about Hillary Clinton— and it’s a daily guessing game to know where he stands on every issue. (This </span><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/12/the-massive-flip-floppery-of-donald-trump-explained-in-238-seconds/"" target=""_blank""><span>video</span></a><span> sums it up brilliantly.) Don’t keep your donors guessing—even taking simple actions like using your mission statement and logo consistently will help.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lesson #4: Make your supporters the hero.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Show your donors that your success as an organization is because of their generous contributions. </span><span>We’ve learned that there’s one thing that Donald </span><span>Trump cares most about: Donald Trump. His ego-driven communications mean he never stops talking about his own self-proclaimed success. But where are the American people in his story? </span><span>Put this lesson into practice by thinking about the role of the donor in your fundraising communications. Using more “you” and less “we” in your writing ensures you’re giving donors the credit for results, which can give them that warm glowing feeling. This helps them feel like their contributions matter, building trust and inspiring them to give again. Try Tom Ahern’s </span><a href=""https://bloomerang.co/blog/do-your-donor-communications-pass-the-you-test/"" target=""_blank""><span>“You test” </span></a><span>on a draft of your next fundraising letter. </span></p>
<p><span>How is your nonprofit doing with building trust with donors? If you’re not sure—or if you want to test your assumptions—check out Big Duck’s </span><a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank""><span>Brandraising Benchmark</span></a><span>, a new research tool we’re offering that can help your nonprofit measure brand awareness, including whether or not Americans find you trustworthy. (We’ve even got one that will measure what politically progressive Americans think about your organization.)</span></p>

<p>--</p>
<p>A root canal or a donor call? Ummm. You choose the root canal every time, right?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I was like you. Asking someone for money? A rush of abject terror ensues at the prospect, followed by multiple fears - fear of failure, fear of humiliation, fear of spilling your coffee on your prospective donor’s white suit or dress or throwing up on their white rug or sitting on their cat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">By contrast, what could happen in the dentist’s chair? Yes, a little pain; but doc, hit me with the needle and don’t spare the Novocain, and wake me when it’s over.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There is no Novocain for a fundraising call, is there?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Actually there is. It’s called, spreading the good news. The religious among us would call it spreading the Gospel, but let’s be non-sectarian for a moment. You are spreading the good news, and that is a very good thing for your soul.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Take me. Thirty years ago, I was approached to join the board of Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC). Why I hadn’t thought of this on my own is a pretty good indicator that I had zero desire to raise money for the organization. Now, I had given speeches for Planned Parenthood and written about Planned Parenthood and cared deeply about the cause, but joining a board meant raising money. Isn’t that what joining a board is ultimately about? Yes, I know, there is all the stuff about stewardship and fiduciary responsibility and sharing your expertise and all that, but to get right down to it, the organization needs money and, if you are on the board, you are the conduit to the funds they need. That’s what they pay you the big bucks for, except that they aren’t paying you the big bucks. No bucks actually. So why would anyone volunteer to give up their valuable time when the price of admission is having to badger your friends and acquaintances and having them stop returning your phone calls, emails, tweets and texts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I’m thinking about all this as two board members from PPNYC are sitting in my office grilling me about my beliefs about choice. I pass their test. They invite me to join the board. One meeting a month, they say with straight faces. I say I’m busy at my job but could handle that, so long, I add, that I don’t have to do any fundraising. No problem they say. And I’m on the board, and within a year I am Chair of the Board Development Committee and attending a meeting a week and making fundraising calls on the side.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What happened?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What happened was New Year’s Eve. I’m sitting at my desk, checkbook in hand and I’m figuring out how much money I have left after a year living beyond my means. I make a list of the organizations I care about. Planned Parenthood tops the list but performing arts organizations and my schools are there too. Would they all survive without me? Yes. But would I survive without writing checks to them? Yes, but in some diminished way. I would be lessened in some way. As I wrote the checks, by hand – this is in the days with no computer generated checks or internet transfers or GoFundMe campaigns - the dusk falls, my wife calls out that we are late, and this feeling of warmth comes over me as I’m giving away money, taking money from myself and my family and giving it to people who need it more that I do through &nbsp;the organizations that help them. It felt good.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That’s what fundraising is. Giving others the chance to get that feeling. Giving them the opportunity to feel good, to feel warm inside, to be part of something larger than themselves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You sure don’t get that feeling at the dentist’s office.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1413%1","Why fundraising isn't as terrifying as it seems","Making a fundraising call to donors can be nerve-racking, but the warmth you feel from giving makes the experience worth it.

Big Duck exists at the crossroads of those two worlds, so we stumble over a lot of jargon in our daily lives. As much as possible, we recommend avoiding it. Often, jargon is a hurdle that keeps your audiences from understanding -- and ultimately supporting -- your mission.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But when can or should you use jargon? Here are three potential scenarios:</span></p>
<p><strong>1) When a new or unfamiliar word creates opportunities for engagement</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Our CEO and founder Sarah Durham wrote a book called Brandraising, and now you’ll see that term all over our website. We have found that, by embracing the term, we’re able to have interesting conversations with clients and potential clients about the relationship between organizational branding and fundraising.</p>
<p>So if you’re dealing with new or unfamiliar jargon, go ahead and ask yourself: Does the word or phrase encourage people to learn more, or does it cause them to tune out? If you can pique interest, you probably have an opportunity on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>2) When you do a lot of peer-to-peer communications</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For many of our clients who are part of a larger movement -- especially if they’re creating partnerships across organizations that do similar work -- using insider jargon is actually effective short-hand. A term like </span><span>heteronormativity</span><span> might confuse some people or require some explanation. But within sexual and reproductive health and rights organizations, for example, because staff members will understand what </span><span>heteronormativity</span><span> is (the belief that heterosexual relationships are the norm), this type of “insider” language can help to set context for the work they’re doing and also build camaraderie across organizations.</span></p>
<p><strong>3) When you want to change the framing</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A couple of years ago, we worked with a human services organization that was all about building on the inherent strengths of children and families. It was incredible work. </span></p>
<p>When it came time to do their messaging, from our point of view, they had a whole host of problems to discuss that would help to explain why their work was so important: poverty, violence, addiction, and so on. But no. The problems, too, had to be framed in terms of strengths.</p>
<p>It took a lot of hard work, but we got there. We embraced a lot of jargon around “strength-based” messaging. Which means their hard work will continue, probably for years. But it’s hard work they’re willing to do -- because ultimately they want to change the very nature of the conversation.</p>

They also want to be viewed as central to the issue: the go-to org for a movement, for example. If you’re planning to raise awareness and increase your nonprofit’s visibility, you’ve got hard work ahead. Here are some of the obstacles to watch out for. With good planning and foresight, you can dodge these potential potholes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""></p>
<p><strong>1. Failure to set goals and measure progress</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Raising awareness and increasing visibility are abstract concepts that can be hard to measure. (For more on that, check out my earlier post, “<a href=""/why-raise-awareness"" target=""_blank"">What are we raising awareness for, anyway?</a>”) How much awareness and visibility are enough? How will you know when you’ve achieved them and can celebrate accordingly? And once you’ve reached that point, what comes next?</p>
<p>If you’ve taken the time to write down the specific, measureable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) objectives for your campaign before it launches, you’re already ahead of most nonprofits. Doubly so if you’ve figured out how to measure your objectives with real numbers that will help you know for sure if you’re on track.</p>
<p>Consider qualitative and quantitative metrics that you can benchmark before the campaign and revisit during and afterwards. Maybe 1 out of 100 people claim they’ve heard of you or your issue right now. Your objective might be that by the end of the campaign, 5 out of 100 say they’ve heard of you or your issue. Remember that a sample size of 300 or more is generally considered large enough to be statistically valid, and plan accordingly. We created the<a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank""> Brandraising Benchmark </a>as an affordable way for nonprofits to measure if specific audiences are familiar with them, find their missions personally important, and are likely to donate to help address this, too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Failure to put strategy before tactics</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Often, tactics are selected before the team has defined larger goals, explored alternative approaches, and agreed if they’re a good idea in the first place. For instance, you decide to run an ad campaign before you’ve defined how it will be measured, fixed the website the ad campaign points to, or even discussed if advertising is the right approach in the first place. &nbsp;This generally happens for one of two reasons.</p>
<p>First, your staff and volunteers will naturally gravitate toward the tactics they have expertise with, or those that are most obvious. PR people will want to use media outreach, for instance. People with advertising backgrounds think in terms of ads. Digital folks think in terms of email, social media, and other online channels.</p>
<p>Secondly, Low-Hanging-Fruit-Syndrome kicks in. That’s when nonprofits purchase ads and commit to running an advertising-based awareness campaign because of persistent salespeople offering discounts, for instance. Or you exhibit at a street fair because your staff person’s husband organizes the event. (This is a close cousin of Shiny-Object-Syndrome, where you pick a tactic because your are enamored of a new tool, despite whether or not it is the best use of your limited resources.)</p>
<p>Put pressure on your team to brainstorm multiple approaches that might be effective before you commit to any particular tactics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>3. Failure to grab attention</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Humor and controversy are time-honored strategies that help grab attention. Cutting through the clutter takes strength, not a gentle touch. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgHHX9R4Qtk"" target=""_blank"">2008 Great Schlep campaign</a> is one of my personal favorites, as is this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQTtMXZs2LA"" target=""_blank"">public service announcement, not approved by AJWS</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Some of the most exciting and cost-effective awareness-raising efforts are unexpected and nontraditional. Remember the ice bucket challenge?</p>
<p><strong>4. Failure to connect and inspire</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Once you grab attention, move your audiences toward action by inspiring feelings in them, not lecturing. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnDgZuGIhHs"" target=""_blank"">The Love Has No Labels</a> campaign, created by the Ad Council, does this brilliantly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you’re sending organization-centric messages to try and inspire people, you’ve fallen into this pitfall. Instead, use copy/imagery that inspires and feels personal and audience-centric, not like the usual boilerplate. You’ll know you’re heading in the right direction if the word “you” dominates, not “we” or “us”.</p>
<p>Creating <a href=""/nice_to_meet_you_audience"" target=""_blank"">audience personas</a> that you reread and regularly assess your own writing and graphics against is another useful device to make sure you’re speaking their language, not yours. Rereading Big Duck’s user personas before and after every blog I write helps me write and refine with much greater clarity and purpose.</p>
<p><strong>5. Failure to convert</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your campaign should have a clear call-to-action (CTA) that outlines a simple step your audience will take to advance your goal. Capturing their email is the holy grail: it’s a great way to measure that you’ve converted someone from ‘unaware’ to ‘aware’, and it gives your nonprofit a way to build a relationship. Give people something meaningful in exchange for their email or they won’t have motivation to sign up. Ebooks, videos, and other useful, free ideas are tried-and-true ways to do that. Take a look at our <a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">Rebrand Effect ebook sign up</a>, as an example of a helpful resource and a smart way to get signups (or so we think!)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>6. Failure to engage</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Great! You got their email address! Now what? Too many organizations put all their time and effort into the launch of the campaign and fail to think through what happens after someone converts. Be sure to map out the next steps, starting with an engaging welcome series or drip campaign, before you launch. Those voices in Field of Dreams were wrong: just because you build it, doesn’t mean they’ll come. Using cookies and automated email marketing systems like Hubspot, Pardot, Act-On and others make it possible to engage people ways that feel personalized but require limited hands-on time once they’re set up. <a href=""/contact"" target=""_blank"">Call us if you need help</a>. (Did you catch that CTA?)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>7. Failure to sustain your focus</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If your team isn’t consistently focused on the campaign, over time the people who’ve become watching will slip back down the ladder of engagement, and you’ll be back where you started. That’s a total waste. If you forget about your audiences, they’ll forget about you.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After your campaign launches, your focus should shift toward monitoring, sustaining, and optimizing the campaign over time. Be sure your campaign has the staff attention and funding necessary to keep it on track until you reach your objectives. Typically, this will be over years, not months; set expectations accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>8. Failure to celebrate!</strong></p>
<p>I hate to be a downer, so let’s end on a high note. As you make progress, sharing results along the way will help keep your team motivated. Provide regular ‘report back’ presentations at leadership team or board meetings, for instance. Surface the lessons you’ve learned so they can be used to benefit other projects, too. Keep coming back to, and reporting against, the objectives you set in your campaign brief. Track results in the most measureable terms possible, then share insights anecdotally. You might even post results in social media, your blog, or other forums too, encouraging those who’ve taken action to see themselves as part of the larger community and feel even better about their commitment to you and your cause. And bonus points to those of you who report back to your community. Those activists, donors, and program participants will be even more motivated to take action the next time you ask if they feel part of your success.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1409%2,1408%3,1407%4","Roadblocks to avoid while raising awareness","Eight common problems nonprofits are likely to face during their attempt to raise awareness.","","roadblocks to raising awareness","awareness branding","awareness branding visibility","<p>Image by <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/joiseyshowaa/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to joiseyshowaa's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""149"">joiseyshowaa</a>&nbsp;(flickr)&nbsp;</p>",

I was particularly struck by his ideas about how fundraising is giving others the chance to feel good and be part of something larger than themselves. His story got me thinking about my own experiences as a board member. &nbsp;I’m currently serving as board chair for the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN), and was previously a board member for the Anti-Violence Project and The Entrepreneurial Development Institute. For years, I’ve wondered, if donating makes us feel good, then why is it so hard to get your board members to donate or raise money? I believe the answer lies in training and knowledge sharing. It’s a problem you can fix!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In their annual nonprofit governance index, </span><span>Leading with Intent, </span><span>Boardsource continually ranks fundraising as the biggest weakness among nonprofit boards. In the 2015 report, </span><a href=""https://boardsource.org/eweb/pdf/LWI-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank""><span>43% of board chairs surveyed said that they think their board members are uncomfortable asking for money</span></a><span>. Consider your board for a moment. Despite a discussion of fundraising expectations during recruitment, are almost half of your board members nervous/anxious/scared when it comes to raising money for your organization?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So how can you get your board members feeling both prepared and motivated to give and get for your organization? As development or communications staff, your job is to provide them with the confidence and tools they’ll need to get involved. Here are five things I’ve seen work well:</p>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Discover each board member’s passion.</strong><span> In one-on-one conversations or as part of a group discussion at your next board meeting, find out why they joined (or remain) on your board. What is it about your mission and serving on your board that gets them going? If possible, keep track of those responses and periodically send them updates that tie into their motivation. If a particular program inspires them, invite them to see that program in action. If an advance in research or a policy issue is what drives their commitment, ask them to join you for a special briefing. If your annual conference is a personal highlight, make sure to leverage that in-person time to connect them with others. Many &nbsp;organizations include program updates in every meeting to help keep that passion alive.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Align yourself toward the same big vision. </strong><span>We define vision statements as an articulation of the better world you are trying to achieve. Vision statements are often revisited or clarified during a strategic planning process, and potentially refined after developing brand strategy. If you have a vision statement, analyze its “motivation index.” Does the statement paint a clear picture of the future you imagine and are working toward creating? </span><a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank""><span>When nonprofits work with us on brandraising projects,</span></a><span> I tend to see vision statements that are either focused solely on the organization’s growth or full of so much jargon that the reader gets bored by the second line. If you find that your vision statement lacks motivation OR you don’t even have one, consider having a discussion at your next board meeting regarding what each board member envisions for your future. I often find that the question, “Imagine we were to go out of business next year. What would the world lose?” is a provocative set-up for eventually landing on your organization’s raison d'être. Getting that vision statement right can be essential to motivating both your board members and your donors.</span></p>
</li>
</ol><ol start=""3"">
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Figure out how to tell your story—and then practice telling it. </strong><span>Exactly what do you do and why does it matter? Another common element of our brandraising work is helping nonprofits tell their story through a strong platform of key messages, boilerplate, and elevator pitch. The elevator pitch gives everyone—board and staff alike—a simple one- or two-sentence response to those wondering just who you are. Getting everyone to start this conversation the same way, with a consistent and compelling explanation, can help prospective donors get a better understanding of what you do. Being able to explain your work with confidence is key to being a good fundraiser.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Expand thinking on roles and responsibilities. </strong><span>Kay Sprinkel Grace touts the </span><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SM4nonprofits/nonprofit-bootcampjune12"" target=""_blank""><span>virtues of a Triple A board</span></a><span>, one where board members are ambassadors, advocates, and askers. As she defines it, an ambassador makes friends and builds relationships; an advocate makes the case and recruits others; and an asker makes the ask and raises funds. If you want your board to be good askers, you need to also give them the tools to be good ambassadors and advocates. Kay suggests that you have each board member complete a survey (example in the link above) of how they want to be involved in each category, and notes that staff will provide training and materials to match each member’s desired fulfillment of those roles. You can see the set of survey questions in the link above. Consider asking your board members to fill it out before your next meeting or via one-on-one conversations.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Make it easy for board members to be fundraisers. </strong><a href=""/crowdfunding-with-your-supporters"" target=""_blank""><span>Getting your donors to be fundraisers comes with its own set of positives and negatives</span></a><span>, but I’m generally a fan. In recent years, it has become a lot easier to have board members set up fundraising pages where the ask for support is practically as easy as sharing the link on Facebook. As a board member, it makes me feel good that I can attract more money than I can personally give, and it gives me a chance to engage my friends in work I believe in. For example, </span><a href=""https://www.crowdrise.com/2016ntenchallenge/fundraiser/farra"" target=""_blank""><span>last year I was able to raise $1,112 for NTEN as part of their year-end fundraising campaign</span></a><span>—more than 5% of the total campaign total of $20,777. Being a member of the team of champions who helped raise those funds gave me the warm fuzzies and led to positive results for the organization.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Beyond these five practices, it also helps to have a fundraising strategy and plan to </span><a href=""/engaging-donors-for-year-round-fundraising"" target=""_blank""><span>communicate and engage donors year-round</span></a><span>, create </span><a href=""http://www.amyeisenstein.com/set-give-get-policy-for-your-board/"" target=""_blank""><span>clear give/get policies</span></a><span>, and provide periodic </span><a href=""https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/self-assessments-nonprofit-boards"" target=""_blank""><span>group and individual evaluations of each board member</span></a><span>. These tools can certainly help jumpstart your work to turn the challenge of board fundraising into an opportunity to spread joy among those who should be your best promoters. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Healthy-Nonprofit-Strategies-without/dp/1119251117/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473437164&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=happy+healthy+nonprofit"">The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit: Strategies for Impact Without Burnout</a></em> (Wiley, 2016), Beth Kanter and Aliza Sherman open up this long-overdue conversation, defining burn out and showing how to practice self-care as a strategy to avoid it.</p>
<p>Too many people work tirelessly in their businesses but not on their businesses. This book mandates that we work on ourselves in our businesses—and, while it’s tailored for nonprofits, each chapter is full of practical tips for any business type. The first section starts with a focus on you, the nonprofit staff person or leader, and what you need to work happily and healthily.</p>
<p>If this were coming from Rodney Yee or Gwyneth Paltrow we’d all be snickering–but it’s coming from Beth Kanter, the sector’s social media and tech wizard, and Aliza Sherman, also a digital diva. When these women tell us to unplug, we take it seriously.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a book that simply suggests that you unplug. It touches on how you work inside and outside your organization in various ways. &nbsp;I particularly appreciated the “5 Spheres of Happy, Healthy Living,” &nbsp;which provides a framework to think about your work in the context of your life.</p>

<p>Worried your organization will go into a tailspin if you start taking time away for self-care? You don’t have to go from working 24/7 to silent meditation retreats: the book is full of practical ideas and suggestions to help you ease into it.</p>
<p>Later sections of this book focus on your nonprofit. The authors dive into culture: how to define it and what it really means to have a happy and healthy one. Last, they map out strategies to create a healthy organization with practical tips that might inspire policies, for instance. The connection is obvious: we need to take care of ourselves, but also to exist in organizations that support healthy ways of working.</p>

<p><strong>Tip #1: Narrow in on an audience.</strong><br />If you are like many of us, you assume a wider audience is going to increase your chances of that hit moment, that viral video or massively successful campaign. The truth is that it really doesn’t work that way. When you create a product, whether it’s a campaign or webpage or video or something else entirely, really what happens is, if you aim to reach everyone with that campaign, your end result will likely be pretty generic. Instead, try to push your team and yourself to get as specific as you can. This works for everything from campaigns, web pages, videos, it works across all different types of content. Ask yourself some questions like these, who exactly are you trying to reach? What’s their age range? Where do they live? What do they do for work or for school? What do they do in their free time? What influences their priorities and choices? What frustrations do they have? Where do they go for news, community and sharing their opinion?</p>
<p>These are just a few questions that you can ask. You might even start with some hypotheses as your answers to these and then work towards getting confirmation on the answers or correcting some of those assumptions over time. In some cases, you may even be able to put together personas for groups of people your organization is trying to reach. Personas simply help you better visualize your audience which can feel daunting as a task by itself. They do that by simplifying the audience into an archetype that makes them more accessible. I’m going to show you some examples from the White House really quickly.</p>
<p>Each graphic (see slide 17) &nbsp;actually spoke to a single persona. We have the athlete, the caregiver, the hipster, the jock, the social media over sharer and the hyper organized. This is probably more of a rare example that our personas ended up being the thing that was public-facing for our audience. Most of the time when you create personas, they’re for your internal use and they end up just being a reference as you say build a new section of your website. If you know your audience for that section of the website is traditional media and you know what their challenges are or what kind of information they’re trying to get, the type of devices they’re looking for that information on, that’s the background thought process that will make your work much more thoughtful.</p>
<p>We also made sure that on Twitter all that content fit right in the middle. Really, the whole point is if you are an athletic millennial and you read that, we’ve just made the case for you in a much more direct way about why you should get healthcare. What we found with this type of specific outreach is it tends to do better because when people feel like something applies to them more directly, they’re going to share it, advocate for it, pass it along to their friends because it doesn’t feel like this generic thing that could relate to anybody. Then you’ve got these external validators who are pushing your content for you.<br /> <br /><strong>Tip #2: Set goals that stretch you.</strong><br />This is actually one that I tell most audiences that I speak to even if I’m talking about design specifically or content strategy. At the heart of it, what this is really saying is, if a goal is easily within reach and is just easily achievable in the time-frame indicated, with the resources that you have then it’s not really a goal at all, it’s a task.<br /> <br />You can easily write down as many of those types of goals as you’d like but really, creating is a to-do list and not a set of goals that’s going to challenge you and push things forward. Goals should push you a little bit beyond your known limits, there should be at least some chance that you’re not going to reach it. You can start by setting goals that are just a smidge out of your reach to see just how far you can stretch. It is when you have goals like that that push you that you’re able to innovate and grow your organization’s capabilities because you’re pushing the boundaries and you’re learning more along the way. Whether your goals are specific to marketing and communications, fundraising, advocacy or something else entirely, I think this applies across all areas. We’re going to look at one example from our team. In this instance, I’m going to talk about the State of the Union during the Obama administration. (see slide 20)<br /> <br />I’m not going to start all the way at the beginning because it’s been a full 8 years of state of the unions now. I’ll start in 2013 for a bit of context which is also one of the first State of the Unions that I was actively involved in. In 2013, we would of course amplify the president’s speech. We would also do this thing that we started during the Obama administration with the creative director before me, Kodiak Starr, we would add graphics to the live streamed address in real time to supplement the content that the president was delivering. The president could only say so much in his address. It’s already covering so many issue areas and is in a short period of time. The graphics supported in being able to share a bit more than the president was able to say directly. The graphics also enabled more visual interest to help capture and retain the attention of the audience and they brought to life concepts that are better seen than heard.</p>
<p>Think about charts or even think about the impact of being able to see a picture of somebody that the president is talking about versus just having his story. That was working really well for us. In 2013, we ended up having about 107 of these slides and these slides are done … They’re a lot of work and they’re done in a short period of time just for some context. Each one was created within a week’s time-frame. We get to see drafts &nbsp;of the ever changing speech and work with policy folks to come up with what the best supplemental content would be to enhance the substance of the speech.<br /> <br />It was 107 of these infographics (see slide 21) that made in at the end in 2013 out of dozens that were made throughout the process and cut. We wanted to do more, we wanted to push our limits. This whole section was about setting goals that stretch you. We knew we wanted to connect with our audience and that meant far more than just putting content in one direction at them with the president’s delivery remarks, we’re also putting graphics up. The next year, we wanted to have a responsive page that fits every device and also allow people to share some of the graphics that resonated with them or be able to reply and ask questions in real time. We used Twitter’s API and we built this tool that you can see underneath here that would show a sampling of the graphic and allow people to engage. <br /> <br />We also somehow managed to up the ante and have 273 enhanced slides in this year which was quite a bit of work. I didn’t think we’d be able to build this tool and somehow we got it done for this 2014 State of the Union but then the next year we wanted to push it even further. We wanted to create a dynamic body of content, not just Twitter because Twitter is still a limited audience of viewership for the White House, we wanted to open up engagement to more of a population in a dynamic way. Here I’m going to show you a video of what we were able to achieve so you can see a glimpse of it. It has no sound so this is just a live video from that speech. You can see a box kind of flipped in this space, we’ve got polls and email sign ups and some of our most popular tweets all integrated. They’re all showing up live related to the substance of the speech. (See slide 23)<br /> <br />Now, if you’d asked us in 2013 if we’d be able to create a page that did all this, we had so many hurdles, we wouldn’t have been able to tell you that we could achieve it. I think even just a few weeks before this 2015 State of the Union, we would have said, “Well, we’re not sure, right?” It’s a true goal, it was a little bit beyond our known limits and we were pushing ourselves to achieve it. In the end, we got it and we were able to innovate. The point being you need to set goals that stretch you in order to innovate and improve your end results.<br /> <br /><strong>Tip #3: See failure as good data.</strong><br />This goes hand in hand with the previous point because if you’re setting goals that are real and goals that are a bit out of reach at the moment, you have a big return if you are able to achieve those goals but you also have to recognize that there’s a chance of failure or probably better put, a chance that you’re simply not going to meet that goal that you’re trying to.</p>
<p>I want to try to reframe failure here and I think this is part of a larger movement and multiple others who are doing this. I think that nonprofits and causes are especially risk and change averse. They are afraid of failure, you guys probably know this but there’s a lot that can be learned from the tech and innovation fields from the past decade where they’re really redefining failure. What we tend to call failure is really just an opportunity to collect more data and information on what will work better for your organization and what won’t. A campaign that’s getting no traction for example, you’ve put together this full campaign for your cause and nobody is engaging, it’s just very low numbers, you’re not sure it’s working quite yet.<br /> <br />If viewed from the traditional lens of failure, this kind of thing could keep the leader of that project from rising to a future challenge that’s going to come their way. It could result in lowering funding for a full department, it could result in cancelling the contract of a freelancer on a project, a ton of negative things. When you look at failure through a lens of new data, you find that each campaign that wasn’t successful will have some things to glean from it for the future. Your new data may be announcing that you launched that campaign on a day with a similar event happening otherwise but you didn’t unite with that other event so you’re splitting your own traffic or you could learn that, really you should have hit pause because there was a disaster that happened somewhere and you were never going to break through the clutter and you should have chosen a different time.</p>
<p>Maybe you learn that your hashtag was a bit too obscure for the audience or your whole campaign should have done natively on a platform like Facebook instead of based in your website when your website doesn’t generally get a lot of traffic. Those are all types of things that maybe they’re hard lessons learned, you don’t want to be the person necessarily that is associated with that lesson learned but they’re really constructive to how you function in the future and really valuable. When you treat failure like an opportunity for data, the way your teams look at it, the lessons you get out of it and the energy that you put into trying again next time, even if it’s for an entirely different topic will be highly improved. Again, I’m going to show you a few examples from the White House from my perspective here. This first one is from a couple of years ago, it’s a little bit painful to watch, I think they called this latte-gate for a few days.</p>
<p>In this case, our team posted some video footage (see slide 25) &nbsp;that we shouldn’t have as a team. There are actually 2 failures here. The first failure in my opinion is that there was no support of the president so that he could hands free and make a salute, the proper way. He’s in the process of on one side and he’s got his hands full, this is just not the best set up. The second failure was just that our team amplified the first failure in pushing this content out. It’s not the end of the world, what we learned was that while we want to get all of the video content out there and we’re aiming to be as transparent as possible as an administration, sometimes these small accidents, when we end up getting it out there and amplifying it, will distract the media from the more important messages of the day. We needed to have better checks and balances and processes for approving video content to be posted to keep us from emphasizing a mistake that would suppress the more important content of the day.<br /> <br />Another example here (see slide 26), this one’s during the correspondence dinner a few years ago when one of the slides didn’t appear for the jokes right after the president told the set up for the joke. For context, this is in front of a large in-person audience of celebrities and policy folks, it’s also in front of a live stream channels across the country and really even the globe. It certainly didn’t feel like a success when it happened, right? We left the president hanging because there was a slide deleted from the jokes at the dinner. It wasn’t the end of the world and we were able to move on from it and actually make it an opportunity by putting more stuff out there and releasing it go the press.<br /> <br /><strong>Tip #4: View platforms as distinct.</strong><br />Many non-profits make this mistake of assuming that social media networks can have the same audiences as each other in the same features and uses. This is actually common in the private and public sector as well. The truth is they’re all different, they have different users with some overlap but all different evolving technologies and algorithms that power them and shifting landscapes which will take adaptability to navigate well. This wasn’t my specialty in the office of digital strategy but I’m going to share a few, little things that I observed. Facebook, Facebook started as a social network for college students but it’s evolved beyond that significantly. You should probably know these things, right? Personally my grandmother is on the platform and has been for years.</p>
<p>I think Facebook may be fighting this trend towards an older audience but the demographics are increasingly ageing so it’s become a great place to engage with anyone from baby boomers to Gen Xers and older millennials. It’s no longer the primary way to engage with centennials or the generation that’s now starting to populate colleges. I think Facebook’s great for short videos, they also perform really well if you post them natively and make sure that they work with the sound off. It’s a great place for longer stories with a thoughtful photo and for Facebook live streams. Facebook can only take a few posts per day because their algorithm doesn’t really promote all of the content to every viewer. Those are all just things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Twitter hasn’t saturated the market but it’s a dominant platform for … I’m generalizing here but educated, city dwelling people who are active on current events or politically opinionated. It’s like a quick news resource for that type of audience. Short videos perform well, animated GIFs, graphics, really concise information, just like Twitter is confined to a certain number of characters. You can post a ton on Twitter each day but you really want to target your audience and try not tweeting the exact same things but respect your audience and their desire for real up-to-date content.</p>
<p>We created the animated GIFs and really linked them to the news of the day. This again (see slide 32) is related to the Supreme Court’s decision on gay marriage. This animated GIF performed so well because it was timely, activating the news audience on Twitter and also had an emotional pull and was made to be consumed in a short period of time for that quick visualization in the timeline. Instagram is highly used by small businesses, celebrities, artists, designers, politicians and the sales industry. It tends to skew younger than Facebook but be a largely adult platform. It’s great for good photos, really short videos and similar to Facebook in this way. Short stories that get paired with the photos or videos. It’s also incredibly useful for niche creative works like calligraphy or character illustration or even things like travel.</p>
<p>You can get really creative and fun on this but try to focus in on one thing and have something that just does that one thing really well. The White House had a takeover on Instagram. A takeover really just means inviting different people, in this case it’s photographers to post content in a series in a specific time-frame. Of course these are so visually compelling and I have short stories from them and it only helps that it’s a guest authorship that’s happening. You click on each one and you can a little bit about a different photographer as well which gives kind of a new magazine feel in a way so that’s Instagram. Snapchat is a platform that’s dominated by centennials right now. It’s hard to use for folks who aren’t as familiar with the marketplace and it’s really great, I think it … At least in the White House context, I’ve found that it excels for those behind the scenes visual moments.</p>
<p>One of my favorite White House snapchat moments which I couldn’t capture here for you all but Lindsay Holtz took for the vice president on the road. This snapchat goes from his foot inside the vehicle when they’re in a motorcade and slowly moves up his leg and then shows him in the vehicle. I think he’s reading something. It’s just this little glimpse into this super behind the scenes moment and the beauty of snapchat is it doesn’t have to be polished or look as professional, something like Instagram so it’s really capitalizing on that moment. Now, Instagram has stories which function a lot like snapchat does in general.<br /> <br /><strong>Tip #5: Roadmap through the moment.</strong> <br />Okay so I mentioned before that the correspondence dinner slide didn’t appear and then we gave it to the press the next day and extended the moment onward into the future.</p>
<p>I just wanted to underline that this can’t happen unless you plan … This works even better when you’re planning for an event if you ramp up into the event and then ramp out of it. We created a little behind the scenes of it that just help us map the things that we wanted to happen before the event, the things that we wanted to happen afterwards. Your tendency is going to be to really cut stuff, to get tired after the event and not do some of your post work. If you map it out, your chances of really continuing the engagement are a lot higher.<br /> <br /><strong>Tip #6: Give space for emotion.</strong> <br />Obviously nonprofits have to communicate credibility, facts and accountability to your supporters and your critics so thinking about how to communicate emotion isn’t always top of mind. We’ve found that relying on emotion sometimes and really going back to some of the basics of Aristotle, this combination of ethos or really showing beliefs and aspiration, trust authority. (See slide 42) Pathos which shows that emotion side or beliefs and then logos which is appealing to ethics, logic and reasoning. Then when we balance all those together, the work is a lot more convincing and then motive adds something really meaningful and dynamic for your audience.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #7: &nbsp;Create and share the real moments.</strong><br />We realized this increasingly over the course of the administration. Here, you’ll see a glimpse at the Alaska page on whitehouse.gov and our team was a big part of sending the president to Alaska to help use that space and him in a physical place that represents climate change, to help tell the narrative of climate change in a much more human and compelling way. We wanted to share those real moments and although it sounds a little counter-intuitive, you have to work to make those happen when you’re in an organization. Of course the president would love to spend time in Alaska, you really make the case why it’s important for the American people, that background isn’t likely to push forward. It was very meaningful and it connected people, it’s a lot more visual, it’s kind of interesting stuff. Have a sense of humor, this one is fairly straightforward, right? (See slide 47)</p>
<p><strong>Tip #8: Have a sense of humor.</strong><br />You want people to respect you, engage with you, to want to come to your social channels and follow you on those social channels. Have a sense of humor, don’t be afraid of making fun of yourself a little bit, it will go a really long way.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #9: Make it dialogue.</strong><br />It’s also tempting to put out information on channels like Twitter in a one directional way but you’re going to capture a lot more intention and make people a lot more engaged by having a dialogue back and forth, not just responding to somebody but giving it a few rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #10: Try to partner.</strong> <br />There’s only so much that you can do from your own brand so do what you can to find somebody who has a different audience than you, who has different capabilities than you to help carry your message through and to work with you.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2063%1,1406%2","#thankObama webinar transcript and slides","Transcription of Ashleigh's social media management tips from her white house webinar.

Time to sharpen your pencils and craft those appeals that will move your donors, right? But what if you’re swamped? Not a great writer? Outsourcing some aspects of your fundraising?</p>
<p>Big Duck often works with nonprofits who need help with <a href=""/online_fundraising_and_awareness_campaigns_for_non_profits"" target=""_blank"">fundraising campaigns</a>, but many organizations don’t have the budget to pass off every aspect of their campaign to a consultant, and others have great in-house capacity that’s smart to leverage, too.</p>
<p>When should you keep the writing for your campaign in-house? When is it smarter to outsource to a writer or agency? Here’s what we’ve learned from helping our clients wrestle with these questions.</p>
<p><strong>When to use internal staff</strong></p>
<p>A nonprofit’s staff knows its mission, its language, its voice, and its community best. With all that already in their head, nonprofit communications staff may be able to knock out content that works well for your organization with relative ease.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and saying, “That’s sounds like my organization,” the next thing you should ask yourself is, “Are any of my staff truly writers?” And, “Are they the right kind of writers?” Many (most?) nonprofit staff wear a lot of different hats, some of which they are more suited to than others. That applies to different types of writing—someone who can craft great major donor asks or direct mail appeals may not have the skill set or expertise to write for email and social media, or to produce a cohesive multi-channel campaign with a strong narrative arc and theme that plays out across all components and channels.</p>
<p>Further, producing effective fundraising copy takes a good amount of mental space and concentration. So, even if you have a good writer with the right kind of writing experience, it is worth considering if she will be able to dedicate the necessary time. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When to use a consultant</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Consultants will guarantee a certain quality because they use (or are) professional writers. They should dedicate the time your content needs because that is exactly what you’re paying them to do!</p>
<p>An external writer or agency is also more likely than staff, who are in the weeds with your cause every single day, to find a surprising angle or add fresh new energy that will make your campaign more dynamic—and can even serve as a model to help re-energize your organization’s content beyond one campaign. And their ”outsider” perspective often helps them express your work in simpler terms that make it easier for donors to get it.</p>
<p>Part of what external writers get paid for is to quickly build the expertise needed to produce strong appeals, so the level of intimacy they have at the outset with a nonprofit’s issues typically shouldn’t be a major roadblock. But if a nonprofit’s work and the issues it confronts are highly nuanced—and its audiences are the kind that will pay close attention to fine, even academic, points of its language—it may be important to find the right person or to make sure they will work closely with internal staff to get the details right.</p>
<p><strong>How to make the call</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The decision often comes down to two things, assuming budget isn’t an issue. First, whether you have a good writer on staff with the relevant experience and bandwidth needed to tackle the task, and how much you’re looking to push the way you communicate with this campaign.</p>
<p>Depending on the specifics of your campaign, these questions may weigh on you differently. For example, if your campaign will consist of a single letter, it may be easy enough to just take care of it in-house, and bringing in a new perspective on one appeal might provide limited long-term value. But if you are producing a more complex multi-channel campaign, with multiple components that need to be versioned for a set of audience segments—it may be a gamechanger to work with an agency or other pro that is able to write for each context while weaving in a theme that helps make your case stronger with every appeal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, the decision may not feel easy or obvious even if you easily fit into one of these scenarios, and in the end the choice is often something of a leap of faith. But, the issues outlined here will help you weigh the pros and cons, and come to the decision that feels best for you.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1416%1,1405%2,1413%3","Who should write your appeal this year-end season","Deciding whether to keep writing in-house or bring in an external writer can be a tough decision when working with a small budget.

Rather than maintaining one unified look, organizations often create new logos, names, and other unique elements for their programs and initiatives. More often than not, this happens because an organization lacks a strategic framework for managing its brand over time. Things can get very messy.</p>
<p>Brand architecture is about defining and expressing the roles and relationships among the various brands and sub-brands of an organization. Sometimes having more complex brand architecture is the strategic thing to do, but usually, less is more.</p>
<p>Managing a single brand successfully is a time-intensive discipline. Managing multiple brands can be nearly impossible—and usually not strategic—for most nonprofits. Complicating an organization’s brand architecture can be counter-productive—both for the staff managing the various brands internally and for the audiences the brands are intended to engage.</p>
<p>What causes nonprofit brands to get so complicated and disconnected? We see two big reasons.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Internal factors</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Without clear guidelines to follow (for instance, in the form of a brand guide or a communications director’s coaching), staff often take the opportunity to develop a new name, logo, color palette, or other elements for a program or initiative. They may feel it’s easier to do that than to navigate red tape, or they may be taking the opportunity to express their own personal tastes or vision for their program.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Organizational silos can also cause issues when it comes to branding. Without strong internal communications, and the clear role of a communications team, brands can take on a life of their own.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">No matter the size of your organization's communication team—whether it’s one person or five—there should be a go-to person or “brand champion” you can seek approval and guidance from about the brand. They should also oversee a simple set of brand guidelines that all staff have access to and make sure new hires and old are clear what they are and how to use them. The brand champion should clearly communicate their role to staff and follow up regularly so that new and long-time staff members are reminded of the guidelines in place.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>External factors</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Brand architecture often gets complicated because of concerns about external perceptions or buy-in. Some of these concerns are less valid than others. For example, in an organization merger or acquisition, one organization may decide to keep the established identity of another in addition to its own to retain any brand equity it may have. Staff may feel like the risk of alienating or confusing longtime supporters by changing the identity of a program just isn’t worth it. Plenty of organizations also choose to name a program or facility in honor of a major donor or influential person in the organization’s history.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Both approaches may seem wise in the short term but can cause branding complications long term. We recommend thinking about what brand architecture system is going to be clearest to your key audiences in the long term. Then work backwards to decide on what interim changes need to be made to your current brand to get there.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ultimately brand architecture is usually the result of unasked questions about whether all the various sub-brands under your organization’s umbrella are really necessary. To be able to navigate these decisions, define a brand architecture strategy that maps out guidelines for sub-branding. This should all be codified in your organization’s brand guide: your organization’s go-to resource for all things branding.</p>

<p>We hope you are participating in #GivingTuesday 2016 as the nonprofit sector tries to build a herd mentality in the same way that online retailers built up Cyber Monday. What’s more, the sector is trying to build a new unselfish social habit, which means it will take more nonprofit participation to compete with the existing holiday corporate messaging. This past year, Cyber Monday revenue grew 16%, topping $3 billion in sales (<a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/01/cyber-monday-sales-top-3-billion-beat-forecast.html"" target=""_blank"">Adobe Digital Index</a>&nbsp;2015). In 2015, Giving Tuesday grew by 145% to a record total of $116.7 million in donations. This year Whole Whale analysts predict that #GivingTuesday will raise over $250 million, read more about this&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wholewhale.com/tips/givingtuesday-stats-and-facts/"" target=""_blank"">and other facts about #GivingTuesday</a>).</p>

<p>There are tons of #GivingTuesday guides, playbooks, toolkits, examples and stories so we decided to try to summarize some of the best ideas as well as add our own. Enjoy!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Join #GivingTuesday.</strong>&nbsp;The rest of these tips don’t really make sense if you aren’t participating… List yourself on&nbsp;<a href=""http://givingtuesday.org/join"" target=""_blank"">GivingTuesday.org/join</a></li>
<li><strong>Draft a quarterback.</strong>&nbsp;Have an internal point person executing the plan and creating wrap up analysis with learnings for next year (this doesn’t have to be your classic fundraising person either). Have them recruit a team of volunteers/super supporters from your network. Pro-tip: give this group a title like #GivingTuesday Advisors.</li>
<li><strong>Beat those pesky giving lines #GivingMonday.</strong>&nbsp;Look, if the generous profiteers at Kmart can&nbsp;<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/29/news/economy/black-friday/"" target=""_blank"">start Black Friday at 6am</a>&nbsp;on ThanksGiving – you can ‘open your doors’ early and count donations for your campaign starting Monday (or earlier). Feel free to use this joke when you do it.</li>
<li><strong>Use social norms and price anchoring.</strong>&nbsp;The average donation amount in 2013 was $140 (Blackbaud). Make this subtly known on your donation form options and copy. Yes, we know averages are&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wholewhale.com/the-7-deadly-sins-of-data-analysis"" target=""_blank"">wildly misleading</a>&nbsp;– but it’s for a great cause. Geek out on more<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Revised-Edition/dp/006124189X"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;influence tactics</a></li>
<li><strong>Focus on new donor cultivation&nbsp;</strong>while using it as an opportunity to rally existing supporters to ‘friend raise’ and pull in their friends by donating themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A message from your constituents.</strong>&nbsp;Plan a Youtube video with recorded “I gave because” from your super supporters – with donate button. Release it on Monday and throw some ads behind it. Here is a great one the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sho6owGco&amp;list=UUEwLnD6-KxGvKqnohdQ8lCw"" target=""_blank"">Michael J. Fox Foundation</a>&nbsp;created from supporter letters.</li>
<li><strong>Host a live YouTube ‘telethon’</strong>, announce new donors and interact with social media interactions. Pro tip: register for&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtube.com/nonprofit"" target=""_blank"">YouTube.com/nonprofit</a>&nbsp;and make sure you have a strong internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Put your CEO in a dunk tank.</strong>&nbsp;Well it doesn’t have to be a dunk tank, but you get it. This idea is inspired by our friends at DoSomething.org who put their CEO, Nancy Lublin and COO, Aria Finger in a dunk tank and only dunked them if they hit a million for their annual event. We were there, it was&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.dosomething.org/files/2013-quarter2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">awesome</a>. Pro-tip: combine this with #7.</li>
<li><strong>Karma.</strong>&nbsp;Find a cause you care about and donate to it on #GivingTuesday. Never hurts to have (good) karma on your side.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule it.</strong>&nbsp;Schedule out your giving reminders across all major platforms using HooteSuite, Facebook scheduled posts, and your email scheduler. Try to analyze peak times your followers are active – we like&nbsp;<a href=""http://follwerwonk.com/"" target=""_blank"">FollowerWonk</a>&nbsp;for analyzing followers on Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Ink your supporters</strong>. Create temporary hand tattoos with your &nbsp;{logo} + #GivingTuesday or #Unselfie. Send these to volunteers ahead of time, ask them to ask staff during lunch to collect. These can also be used as incentives for early giving or participation. Here are&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.tattoosales.com/customtattoo.aspx"" target=""_blank"">the cheapest ones&nbsp;</a>we found – 1000 for $100</li>
<li><strong>Reputation matters</strong>. New volunteers will be evaluating new nonprofits based on rating sites. Check to make sure you are updated in places that matter: Guidestar.com, CharityNavigator.com, GreatNonprofits.org, Wikipedia.org.</li>
<li><strong>Time sucks suck…</strong>&nbsp;Participate, but don’t let this take too much time! Time is money, manage expectations on returns for your work.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Start early.</strong>&nbsp;Trends for Cyber Monday and Giving Tuesday show people gearing up in August/September.<a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trends%20for%20%23CyberMonday%20and%20%23GivingTuesday%20show%20people%20gearing%20up%20in%20August%2FSeptember%2C%20start%20early%21&amp;via=wholewhale&amp;related=wholewhale&amp;url=https://www.wholewhale.com/29-ideas-for-giving-tuesday/"" target=""_blank""><br /></a></li>
<li><strong>Blitz your message!</strong>&nbsp;Have super supporters schedule tweets that say “I gave to @{YourCharity} #GivingTuesday” for December 2nd, 2014.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thunderclap.it/"" target=""_blank"">ThunderClap</a>&nbsp;is a great tool for this.</li>
<li><strong>Better together</strong>– don’t worry about crowded messaging, we are increasing the size of the pie, which means your slice will be larger. Think about how you can collaborate with other orgs in your cause area. Donation averages per charity involved in 2012 &amp; 2013 stayed relatively even as total charities involved increased by 250%.</li>
<li><strong>Matching Gifts</strong>&nbsp;are to #GivingTuesday as deals are to #CyberMonday. &nbsp;Create urgency by creating a 24-48 hour period where donations will be matched. Use Double the Donation’s&nbsp;<a title=""matching gift givingtuesday"" href=""https://doublethedonation.com/giving-tuesday/"" target=""_blank"">#GivingTuesday Matching Gift Pages</a>&nbsp;for free.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t cannibalize your holiday messaging.</strong>&nbsp;This is just the start of the race – not the final sprint. Think about positioning this as participating in a social movement to combat the shitty commercialism that has taken over one of best excuses to eat turkey with in-laws.</li>
<li><strong>TEST YOUR DAMN DONATE PAGE.</strong>&nbsp;This should happen well before #GivingTuesday. We have had increases of 20% and higher for every page we have A/B Tested for our Whole Whale clients.</li>
<li><strong>First Tuesday giving</strong>. Offer an option for donors to repeat their donations on the first Tuesday of every month.</li>
<li><strong>Be a part of the conversation.</strong>&nbsp;Be hyperactive on social and consider running ads in the afternoon 1-4pm when donation activity peaked on #GivingTuesday in 2013 (Blackbaud).</li>
<li><strong>Prepare a landing page.</strong>&nbsp;Promote your Giving Tuesday campaign on your site’s homepage, and across subpages so that all visitors will know about it. Create a focused giving page just for #GivingTuesday and promote that exact page, don’t make people click to find your donate button please.</li>
<li><strong>Progress meter!</strong>&nbsp;Set a donation goal and show users the progress towards that amount. Pro-tip: feel free to raise the goal if donations start pouring in and try to seed early donations to get started. We like&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/partners/givingtuesday"" target=""_blank"">IndieGoGo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://tilt.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tilt</a>, but you can also fake this functionality by manually updating an image on your site as you hit milestones.</li>
<li><strong>Say thanks!</strong>&nbsp;Show a feed of Twitter users who have donated and try to thank each one that donates with #GivingTuesday.</li>
<li><strong>Make donations tangible.</strong>&nbsp;Will the money go toward a new program or needed equipment? Giving transparency can help your story when getting ‘fence-sitters’ to convert.&nbsp;<a href=""https://community.givingtuesday.org/post/details/f799dfcc-1dbc-4150-a1b4-948e2dded923"" target=""_blank"">Lakeside Chautauqua</a>&nbsp;managed to raise $105k by focusing on a local restoration project in their community.</li>
<li><strong>Be #Unselfie (ish).</strong>&nbsp;Encourage your members to share their #unselfie(s) with you on Twitter, FB, and Instagram. Try to highlight the best stories – Once again, The Michael J. Fox Foundation&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?take-an-unselfie-and-share-why-you-give"" target=""_blank"">did this very well</a>&nbsp;in 2013.</li>
<li><strong>The best ideas are not in the room.</strong>&nbsp;Look to your supporters for great fundraising stories that you can bring national attention to. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/creative-giving-for-kids-by-kids/"" target=""_blank"">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a>&nbsp;did this well by finding a 10 year-old who was selling barrettes to raise money to help her friend struggling with the disease.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore corporate giving!</strong>&nbsp;Companies are just like people (<a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hobbylobby&amp;src=typd"" target=""_blank"">#HobbyLobby</a>) and may have employee giving programs you can tap into or find matching gifts through. America’s Charities is a leader in running workplace giving campaigns and has some&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.charities.org/news/7-ways-leverage-your-company%E2%80%99s-social-responsibility-initiatives-givingtuesday"" target=""_blank"">great tips</a>&nbsp;for #GivingTuesday corporate giving.</li>
<li><strong>Did it work?</strong>&nbsp;Create a December donation forecast, then measure total donations for December and on #GivingTuesday. Ask the question: Did we cannibalize giving, redistribute to Tuesday, or increase it?</li>

<p>One of the most important of those details is segmentation—how to break down your supporter list into distinct groups based on...well, we’ll get to that in a minute. While the cost of direct mail tends to force nonprofits to think closely about how they segment donors offline, too many nonprofits are still emailing the same content to their full list or based on very simple categories (e.g., donors vs. nondonors).</p>
<p><span>Given the </span><a href=""http://www.customerexperienceinsight.com/customer-expectations-you-must-meet-now/""><span>expectation most people have for personalized content online</span></a><span>, not to mention all the evidence out there from the ecommerce world showing how </span><a href=""http://conversionxl.com/personalized-marketing/""><span>personalization drives revenue</span></a><span>, segmentation is an essential element of any successful online fundraising strategy. But because more segmentation also means a higher burden on staff time, it’s important to carefully consider what you can handle and understand how different segmentation strategies can benefit your fundraising program.</span></p>
<p>Here are three segmentation strategies to consider implementing for your year-end campaign:</p>
<p><strong>1. By giving history</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>By separating donors from nondonors, you will be able to tell your donors just how important they are, a key tactic for driving loyalty and increasing donor retention. </span></p>
<p>But taking a more granular approach to segmenting by giving history can have a much more immediate impact, driving more and higher levels of giving this holiday season. By analyzing the levels your donors tend to give at, you can organize donors into low-, mid-, and high-level groups and provide them with appropriate gift strings. For example, if you find that a third of your donors give between $250 and $1,000, you will encourage more donors to maintain or increase their giving levels by presenting them with a gift string that starts at $250. If your CRM allows, you could even present each donor with a gift string that dynamically populates based on their individual giving history.</p>
<p>Another important benefit of giving-history segmentation is the ability to break out active donors (typically defined as constituents whose last gift was within the past 36 months) from lapsed donors. Lapsed donors should generally receive gift strings that set the bar for re-entry into the active donor pool at relatively low values. But targeted messaging to this group can also provide an immediate bump to your campaign. Generally donors who stopped giving for more than three years have disengaged from your cause to a certain degree, and may need an even harder push than someone who just hasn’t made the decision to make their first gift yet. Sending lapsed donors subject lines along the lines of “We haven’t heard from you in a while” or even “Do you still care about our cause?” will drive higher unsubscribe rates--but it will also get the attention you need to re-engage lapsed supporters and drive more donations.</p>
<p><strong>2. By relationship</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Depending on the data your organization has, you can segment your list based on constituents’ relationships to your nonprofit (e.g., donor, volunteer, advocate, program participant) or by their relationships to your cause (e.g., parents of a child with a rare disease vs. friends of families affected by that disease). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Segmenting by relationship is a longer term strategy—not that many supporters are going to give today just because you refer to their volunteer activity or address them as a caregiver. But it has been clearly shown in ecommerce that consistently communicating to constituents based on their shopping and browsing history helps to drive sales and foster longer customer relationships. Over time, regularly acknowledging your constituents’ relationships to your nonprofit or cause will help your supporters see themselves in your work, understand that you value and know something about their personal experience—and build the loyalty and appreciation needed to generate gifts and increase your donors’ </span><a href=""https://www.donorperfect.com/nonprofit-technology-blog/2008/06/calculating-donor-life-time-value/""><span>lifetime value</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>3. By interest</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not everyone joins your list or donates because they are inspired by your overall mission. Sometimes people donate to a food bank because they care about disadvantaged children, not because hunger is their issue, or to an education nonprofit specifically because they are passionate about arts education.</span></p>
<p>If you take all of these supporters and send them the same messages, which often won’t touch on or give enough prominence to the issues they care about, you risk losing relevance—and dollars.</p>
<p>Like segmentation by relationship, interest segmentation—based on initiatives constituents gave to or signed petitions about, or issues they told you they care about in a survey—is a long term strategy. Using this approach, you can provide supporters with content that highlights the specific issues they care about and makes clear how those issues fit into your overall mission. Over time, this will keep supporters engaged and build loyalty.</p>

<div dir=""ltr"">One of the most common conditions we find is something we call “Laundry List Syndrome.” Untreated, it can weaken an organization’s communications and ultimately affect their ability to maintain their work over time.

<div dir=""ltr""><strong>What is LLS?</strong></div>
<p dir=""ltr"">Once you know what you’re looking for, the symptoms are easy to spot. Organizations suffering from LLS often find themselves only able to talk about their organization in terms of the programs they run; unable to tell the larger story that weaves their work together. And once they mention one program, they end up listing them all. That means potential supporters are left with a nice long list of names—and little sense of why or what the organization as a whole does.</p>
<div dir=""ltr""><strong>Who’s at risk?</strong></div>
<p dir=""ltr"">Larger organizations with lots of programs and a weak organizational brand.</p>
<div dir=""ltr""><strong>What’s the cure?</strong></div>
<p dir=""ltr"">Luckily, LLS is quite curable. We’ve found that the best treatment combines a <a href=""/nonprofit_brand_marketing_strategy_and_logo_design"" target=""_blank"">rigorous brandraising process</a> with a course of <a href=""/family-of-brands-architecture"" target=""_blank"">brand architecture</a>. When staff has a story to tell about the organization as a whole, they won’t need to resort to listing every program and every initiative. And when they do need to discuss what goes on at the program level, having clean brand architecture will give them the tools they need to ladder those programs up to their organizational messaging.</p>

<div dir=""ltr""><span>In 2016, Big Duck had the opportunity to work with Atlanta Community Food Bank, a powerhouse anti-hunger organization with a touch of southern charm, to reimagine their brand (read all about it </span><a href=""/atlanta-community-food-bank-rebrand"" target=""_blank""><span>here</span></a><span>).</span><span> First, we established their new brand strategy and identity, and then we developed a multichannel rollout plan to introduce it to their community.</span></div>
<div dir=""ltr""></div>
<p></p>
<div dir=""ltr"">I interviewed Julie Bryant Fisher, Chief Marketing Officer, and Allison Young, Marketing Manager, about their experience rolling out their new brand and their recommendations for other nonprofits planning a rebrand. Here’s what they shared:</div>
<div dir=""ltr""></div>
<p></p>
<div dir=""ltr""><strong>Ally, Big Duck: What did rolling out your new brand successfully mean to your team?</strong></div>
<p></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Julie, Atlanta Community Food Bank:</span></span></strong><span> Success meant marrying mission with a refreshed look that would send a “get noticed” signal to the community. Hunger is a critical issue, and urgency around ending hunger in our community is vital, achievable, and is something we do together. Success was also very much getting consensus from multiple audiences (board, stakeholders, staff) that we were making the right move with the right look. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Allison, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank:</strong><span> Success also meant that we not only got love from our staff and constituents, but also from the “old guard.” We have a lot of people at the Food Bank who are 20+ year employees, not to mention constituents who have been with us since our founder was working out of the basement of a local church. The blue and the cornucopia have been long-standing icons of the Food Bank for so long that changing these things felt very nerve wracking. Getting their buy-in was so important.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ally, Big Duck: Specifically, how did you engage your staff in the brand rollout?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Julie, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank: </strong><span>This turned out, for us, to be our biggest pivot point. Consider, though, that our staff was pretty change-fatigued coming into this rollout on the heels of a onboarding a new CEO and weathering a massive re-org and launch of a new 10-year strategic plan. It became critical to consider how to engage staff, knowing they could not collectively play a big role in the actual design of the new logo and tagline. Making it fun and engaging became a vital concept. It was the little things that counted—a fun “trunk show” to unveil new brand uniform options; fun swag giveaways at staff meetings where we were simultaneously covering all of the necessary communications around the rollout; an engaging, ceremonial staff exercise and lots of cupcakes and goodies to sweeten the goodbye for a brand that had been near and dear for a long time. Must also say that one of our best investments, besides Big Duck, was the creation of a fun, light-hearted, celebratory </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/atlfoodbank/videos/vb.50304750730/10154343265750731/?type=2&amp;theater"" target=""_blank""><span>brand launch video</span></a><span> to say farewell to the old look and introduce the new!</span><span><br class=""kix-line-break"" /></span><span><br class=""kix-line-break"" /></span><strong>Allison, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank: </strong><span>To echo Julie’s comments, we also went department by department to go through the steps we took to get to the new brand and to show them how it would be implemented across different areas that may have meant the most to them (trucks, letterhead, etc.). Because we were so change-fatigued, the fact that we were careful to go to every single department and show them the new look helped.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ally, Big Duck: What has your community’s response been so far to the new brand?</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Julie, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank:</span></span></span></strong><span> Overwhelmingly positive. From our partner agencies to our stakeholders, board members and volunteers—just about everybody has said “We love the new look!” and has been proudly wearing the abundant amount of swag items we handed out.</span><strong><span><span><span><br class=""kix-line-break"" /></span><span><br class=""kix-line-break"" /></span><span>Allison, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank</span><span>: </span></span></span></strong><span>There’s been a lot of revitalization about the Food Bank and what we’re doing because people are noticing the change.

Coming up with the new look is just the starting point. Fully planning how to make sure the brand is effectively launched, accepted and that it gets teed up for a long, highly visible life, is where the real work begins. It is really critical to build a well-constructed plan to consider everything from letting key stakeholders under the curtain early (no surprises), to how to get staff to turn in their old uniforms and wear the new ones, to planning far enough in advance for the simultaneous creation and rollout of new marketing collateral, etc…<br class=""kix-line-break"" /><span><br class=""kix-line-break"" /></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>Allison, <strong>Atlanta Community&nbsp;</strong>Food Bank</span><span>: </span></span></span></strong><span>Have Big Duck on your side. But also, making sure you’re keeping in mind ALL of the moving parts—for us, we had people who wanted to order items prior to our fiscal year ending, and identifying ALL of the places our logo lives, which was much more than we had anticipated.</span></p>

<p><strong>Brand architecture</strong> is the name we give to the complicated network of roles and relationships between your organization’s programs, initiatives, events, publications, spaces—all the things that you do, own, and are known for. You might refer to them as “brands” or “sub-brands.” Perhaps you don’t think of them as distinct entities with identities of their own. But your audiences often do.</p>
<p>Most nonprofits have grown their brand architecture &nbsp;in an ad hoc way—a clever event name here, an interesting icon there, a legacy group maintained from a merger. It may all seem like small stuff, but eventually it adds up to a big problem: a brand that lacks a coherent, purposeful narrative and fails to make a powerful and focused impression.</p>
<p>Evidence of brand architecture problems pops up in the conversations you have with your team every day.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">“Should we put our logo on our Walk t-shirts?”</h3>
<p>When you have clear and purposefully maintained brand architecture, questions like this won’t be up for debate. If your event is closely branded with the overall organization, the logo will be thoughtfully incorporated into the visual standards you’ve established. If the event has a completely separate brand designed to reach a completely separate audience, the main organization logo won’t be appropriate—and everyone will be clear about that ahead of time.</p>
<p>Either way, clear brand architecture saves you time, spares you headaches, AND ensures that the choices you’re making on the ground reflect a smart strategy. Win-win-win.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">“We need a separate website for this program.”</h3>
<p>Setting up lots of unique websites is usually a sign that your team has a tendency to think and communicate in siloes. When you maintain separate sites for each program or event, you give each one a distinct identity—and discourage people from seeing your work as many parts making up a coherent whole. You’ll have to work even harder to help them see the other great work you do and feel inspired support your organization overall.</p>
<p>[Side note: this issue could also be a sign that <a href=""/website-rethink-flowchart"" target=""_blank"">it’s time to redo your website</a>.]</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">“Our gala is coming up in a few months: time to start thinking about a logo.”</h3>
<p>Sound the alarm! If your team is in the habit of making logos and coming up with names for lots of events or programs or initiatives, odds are good that you’re creating unnecessary confusion and weakening your overall brand impression.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that you can’t have special treatments for certain programs or a distinct look and feel for your big event—but it’s important to be strategic about it. Well-developed brand architecture strategy usually includes clear criteria for when it’s appropriate to stretch your brand and how far (e.g., a customized name or theme might be okay—but not a separate logo).</p>
<p>When you allow key programs to take on lives (and messages and audiences) of their own without thoughtfully connecting them to your organization’s overall brand, you’re missing an opportunity—and you’re making it all too easy to stay lost in the shuffle of great causes. Strategic brands with clear hierarchy, a consistent look, and a unified message have a leg up in a messy and inconsistent world.</p>
<p>Any of these challenges sound familiar? If so, it might be time to step back and consider whether you have a problem with your brand architecture (it happens to the best of us—check out this <a href=""/bad-brand-architecture"" target=""_blank"">helpful piece by fellow Duck Ally Dommu on some of the causes of brand architecture issues</a>).</p>

<p>I’ve been a huge fan of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/"">GivingTuesday&nbsp;</a>since I first heard about it back in September, 2012 during a conference at Stanford. I’m pleased to see that some of the skepticism and complaints have now morphed in to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/events/"">more capacity builders</a>&nbsp;providing&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog/2014/10/16/5-ways-to-harness-the-awesome-fundraising-potential-of-givingtuesday/"">tips for nonprofits to take advantage of this national day of giving.</a>&nbsp;Giving Days&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.knightfoundation.org/publications/10-lessons-knight-foundation-giving-day-initiative"">organized by local communities</a>&nbsp;are being adopted by many more communities than ever before and a stronger understanding how these efforts can help build the capacity of nonprofits to embrace social media and online giving, engage more donors, and raise awareness of charity giving.</p>
<p>What I have always appreciated about GivingTuesday since the beginning is how they innovate and anticipate new trends in giving and incorporate into the campaign – either as toolkits or techniques for nonprofits to test and adopt. This past summer, I was an instructor at GivingTuesday’s Summer School where I made a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET-X629u-HE"">video</a>&nbsp;with some encouragement and tips for using GivingTuesday to experiment with new techniques, donor segments, or practices. GivingTuesday is done it again with its&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/guide-to-giving-3/"">K-12 Philanthropy Curriculum</a>, a set of lesson plans that teachers can use to help their students participate in GivingTuesday by raising money for a local nonprofit.</p>

<p>With this resource, GivingTuesday is helping nonprofits experiment with a donor segment that is rip for cultivation by nonprofits — &nbsp;“<a href=""http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/get-ready-for-generation-z/"">Gen Z</a>.” &nbsp; &nbsp;This generation is loosely defined as those born after 1995 and who are now 18 and under. &nbsp;It’s a huge group: two billion worldwide. &nbsp;Research points to the emergence of a dynamic generation: educated, industrious, collaborative and eager to build a better world (see slide 10). &nbsp; Gen Z is already being branded as a welcome foil to the Millennials, born between 1980 and the mid- or late 1990s, who have been typecast as tolerant but also overconfident, narcissistic and entitled. &nbsp;Gen Z is the first post-9/11 generation, one raised in an age of economic instability, orange terrorism threats, in the shadow of global warming, and globally connected via social media and mobile phones.</p>

<p></p>
<p>How do businesses and nonprofit reach out to this generation? A good checklist and some recommendations can be found on slides 50-53. But remember, these “<a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/kids-crowd-funding/"">PhilanthroKids</a>” &nbsp;are not necessarily the donors of tomorrow, in many case they are the donors of today and want to do it their way. &nbsp;During my time at the International Fundraising Congress, I met this young lady, Betty, who was attending the conference to research and network with nonprofits to partner with for her fundraising idea to make the world a better place. &nbsp; She’s only 10 years old! &nbsp; This isn’t just an isolated case – here’s an example of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.learnvest.com/2011/12/10-big-time-philanthropists-who-just-happen-to-be-kids/?gallery=396#pid-5032_aint-0"">10 big time philanthropists</a>&nbsp;who are kids, including a 13 year old who raised $600,000 for charity.</p>
<p>While some children are taught about giving to charity at home, we are seeing more and more philanthropy curriculum being integrated into the classroom. &nbsp; The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/giving2"">Giving 2.0 Mooc</a>&nbsp;is an example at the college level where college students are not only learning about the world of philanthropy, but are also giving away a grant to a nonprofit organization as part of their work. &nbsp; &nbsp; But is philanthropy a part of a Gen Y’s schooling? &nbsp; &nbsp; During the recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/icebucket-2/"">ALS IceBucket Challenge</a>, lots of kids were involved and I noticed some educators, like&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.coolcatteacher.com/ice-bucket-challenge-bellringer/"">Vicki Davis</a>, incorporating it as a classroom lesson.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/guide-to-giving-3/"">GivingTuesday Curriculum</a>&nbsp;includes ten lesson plans that helps understand philanthropy and helps them reflect and develop their own philanthropic initiatives by<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-5.pdf"">&nbsp;choosing a nonprofit</a>&nbsp;in their community and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.givingtuesday.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-6.pdf"">partner with them</a>&nbsp;on GivingTuesday.</p>

<p>We’ve all had them: moments when you realize what’s just happened is a game-changer—and you didn’t see it coming. Sometimes the change is internal: a key staff or board member unexpectedly departs, budgets are cut, fraud occurs, etc. Sometimes, despite our best-laid plans, the change is external: a recession, a national crisis, or the political landscape dramatically shifts.</p>
<p>Of course, we should nurture positive cultures within our organizations, make succession plans, build up cash reserves, and plan for the unanticipated. We should eat well, exercise, look at our phones less, and get a good night’s sleep, too. But this important (not urgent—until it’s too late) self-care is often the first stuff to go during a busy time, or when staff is spread thin.</p>
<p>After the fact, everybody has an opinion about what might have been done differently—and, sure, we might have done so. But what do you do right now, when the $#%@) has hit the fan?</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Empower individuals not teams</h3>
<p>Nonprofit cultures value buy-in and collaboration. But making decisions slowly and with too many cooks in the kitchen can be devastating during a moment of crisis, especially when others in your space are moving quickly and appear to be better prepared.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, November 9, 2016, just hours after it was announced that Donald Trump had won the U.S. presidential election, many progressive nonprofits released statements, updated their websites, and sprung into action. Some had the foresight to prepare ‘what if’ scenarios anticipating Trump’s victory, but others hadn’t. What they had was accountable, agile leadership; people who were empowered to make decisions and act fast. They left their slower-moving peers in the dust.</p>
<p>Scared that the wrong decisions will be made? A bad decision made quickly is better than a better decision made slowly in many contexts. If this style of leadership feels out of whack with business-as-usual at your organization, consider giving people temporary titles and a clear timeline when they hold the seat so it’s clear this isn’t a permanent change (for instance, “Election Response Communications Chief”).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Prioritize speed and candor over comprehensive communications</h3>
<p>Your organization’s values (deeply-held beliefs) should guide as you decide how to respond and craft statements or other communications. An organization that has transparency as a core value, for instance, shouldn’t hesitate to share what’s known and not yet known with its community.</p>
<p>Panic and unproductive chatter will fill the void when it’s not clear what’s going on. Communicate with your key stakeholders quickly and as candidly as possible. Don’t wait until you have all the answers or a perfectly polished statement.</p>
<p>Your organization’s brand strategy should also help you select how you communicate. Use your positioning (the big idea you want people to associate with your organization) as a yardstick for your statements, and be sure the tone and style of your response reflects your nonprofit’s personality, not just that of individuals.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Learn this time for next time</h3>
<p>Building sustainable, resilient organizations should be a priority for every nonprofit’s leadership team, and unexpected moments are just one of many places where that work pays off, potentially changing a bad game-changer into a good one.</p>
<p>Make someone accountable for keeping track of the useful solutions and new ideas that bubble up along the way during today’s crisis or moment of significant change. Create a collaborative document your team can add to, with categories such as, “What worked well was...” and “next time, we should…” or “before this happens again, let’s….” Once the dust settles, debrief with everyone involved using this document to guide your discussion, then decide what, when, how, and who will advance whatever is needed before the next unexpected change.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1409%1,1412%2","Toolbox for unexpected moments","Sometimes you get it wrong—or circumstances shift beyond your control.

Years later, I still get calls from nonprofit leaders who continue to feel pressure to produce annual reports even though they can &nbsp;drain resources and have limited or unclear return on investment (ROI).</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Why I am skeptical about annual reports</h3>
<p>Yes, it’s a best practice to publish your audited financials, and many charity watchdogs encourage or even mandate it. But that can be as simple as embedding a PDF on your website--just a few pages straight from your audit, with little fanfare and no design. So why produce something fancier?</p>
<p>For most nonprofit organizations, a well-written, well-designed annual report is a way to acknowledge and showcase progress to donors. Some reports provide insight into what’s to come in the year(s) ahead. &nbsp;But to produce a good report, costs can be high: most of the mid-size or larger organizations regularly spend 5- or 6-figures on their annual report—not to mention copious hours devoted by staff to gather stories, collect photos, and get approvals. Couldn’t these resources be better invested?</p>
<p>That’s way too much time and money to spend on a document with a limited shelf-life unless you’re certain it’s really working, in my opinion.</p>
<h3 class=""alt"">Try this approach instead</h3>
<p>Before you produce your next annual report, schedule a meeting with the staff who are most likely to use it. That’s probably your CEO, COO, and development team-- especially the major gifts officers. It might even be your board chair and/or members of your development committee.</p>
<p>Here are four questions you might use to spark a productive conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we all on the same page about what we hope the annual report will do for our organization? (probe: Do we agree it’s a major donor cultivation tool? A stewardship tool? A sexy coffee table credibility piece? A place to list donors so they feel acknowledged?)  </li>
<li>Besides mailing or emailing, how do you personally use the annual report in your work? (Probe: Is it used to facilitate meetings? Big asks with major donors? Look up past work? As a way to keep in touch with prospects?) </li>
<li>What specific feedback have you received about past reports? (Probe: Do people actually read it? Does it inspire the types of reactions and results we’d like-- like increased donor retention?)  </li>
<li>Is there a less expensive or easier way we might get the same or even better results? (Brainstorm: Could you post a short video on your website, perhaps-- or produce something with a longer shelf-life with inserts? Should you focus on more frequent, shorter updates to donors vs. investing deeply one annual report?)  </li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""alt"">If you must produce an annual report</h3>
<p>Personally, I’d rather see you invest tens of thousands of dollars on building the capacity of staff people, or on longer-shelf-life, higher value types of communications, wouldn’t you? So if you feel you must produce an annual report, consider dialing it back this year. Here are a few ways to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it short and sweet.</strong> Financials plus a letter from your CEO, referencing high-level accomplishments and/or linking to your website, which can be updated in real time.  </li>

<p>Who decides the priorities for your communications team and controls the workload?</p>
<p>Do you know how that compares to other nonprofits?</p>
<p>We are attempting to answer those questions for you in the <a href=""http://npmg.us/2017"" target=""_blank"">2017 Nonprofit Communications Trends Report</a>.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary results from more than 600 nonprofits, there’s no one clear answer.</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/msQMGvG4XWlY-ykYip1LC-6eRBxgHGWA30Yhfsw0lXcEd6foEVe1EQOIuQ8mFZoA_29k1wzutwm9oA6NhNEPC1_INC8gtJQElg60dordYC0bnohXoeMq6PL-Jzt836D1W_85Hx9P"" width=""624"" height=""348"" alt=""HowWorkloadisCreated-PrelimData.jpg"" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><br />The most frequent response is that an integrated team of communications and fundraising staff jointly decide on the workload.</p>
<p>But that’s followed closely by other models where the executive director determines the workload, where the communications department acts as an “internal agency,” and where the communications team itself defines its workload.</p>
<p>Do you think the approach in your organization is under-represented or over-represented in these results?</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://npmg.us/2017"" target=""_blank"">survey</a> for the report is open until December 2, 2016 and we want to hear from as many nonprofit communications staff as possible, so <a href=""http://npmg.us/2017"" target=""_blank"">we hope you’ll take the survey</a> and add your perspective.</p>
<p>Everyone who <a href=""http://npmg.us/2017"" target=""_blank"">takes the survey</a> will receive a free copy of the report in January and be invited to a free webinar a week before the results are released.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2059%1","2017 Nonprofit Marketing Report Preview","Brief overview on how communications workloads are created at nonprofits","","communications workload","Communications Marketing","Communications Marketing nonprofitmarketingguide Kivi","",

<p>In the book <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7io-2eqxSS0C&amp;source=productsearch&amp;utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;utm_campaign=PLA&amp;pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&amp;gclid=CPiNktTsutACFVDr6Qod728GZQ&amp;gclsrc=ds"" target=""_blank"">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't</a>, Jim Collins offers a powerfully simple metaphor for explaining what makes a good organization become a great one, which naturally applies to the work of nonprofit rebranding.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>You are a bus driver. The bus, your company, is at a standstill, and it’s your job to get it going. You have to decide where you’re going, how you’re going to get there, and who’s going with you.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>Most people assume that great bus drivers (read: business leaders) immediately start the journey by announcing to the people on the bus where they’re going—by setting a new direction or by articulating a fresh corporate vision.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>In fact, leaders of companies that go from good to great start not with “where” but with “who.” They start by getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats. And they stick with that discipline—first the people, then the direction—no matter how dire the circumstances.</em></p>
<p>Nonprofits embarking on big organizational shifts such as rebranding can also benefit from some of Collins’ thinking, shifting attention away from the “what” to the “who.” Inspired by his bus metaphor, we’ve assembled a few leadership lessons for nonprofits thinking about undergoing a significant rebrand. Safe travels.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invite the right passengers onboard the bus.</strong> Nonprofit rebranding is not a one-person job or a task managed exclusively by a consultant. Rebranding successfully requires assembling the right team for the journey as much as making decisions like what color your new logo should be. Strong leadership entails a well-thought-out plan for engagement and feedback from different areas of the organization—from staff inside and outside the communications team, to senior leadership, to the board, to outside experts and consultants. The earlier you know who needs to be on the bus, the better.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Get the right butts in the right seats.</strong> Effective nonprofit leaders don’t just invite the right people on the bus, they think about getting the right people in the right seats. For nonprofit rebranding, that means mapping out the responsibilities and expectations of those involved in the process based on their connection to the organization and areas of expertise, and clearly communicating how the ultimate decisions will be made. A <a href=""http://racichart.org/"" target=""_blank"">RACI chart</a> is a helpful tool to employ when rebranding: it clarifies roles and responsibilities, making sure that nothing falls through the cracks. RACI charts also prevent confusion by assigning clear ownership for tasks and decisions. We’ve seen that strong nonprofit leaders don't shoulder the full responsibility for decision making or obscure how the decision will ultimately be made or who will make it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Agree upon the destination.</strong> Now that you have the right people in the right seats, work on defining and communicating the destination. Jim Collins explains that this is where many leaders fall short—they start first with the “what” and then shift to the “who.” In the case of the nonprofit rebrand, that means getting aligned about what the rebrand is ultimately in service of (fundraising? greater awareness? advocacy?), identifying who the right audiences are to achieve that goal, and clarifying the strategies to reach them. As a leader, it’s your job to ensure that everyone understands and is bought into what the destination is and how you’ll get there. If everyone on the bus has a different destination in mind, then it’s going to be a tough journey. Some of the most challenging rebrand processes we’ve been a part of happen when key people involved lose sight of why they’re doing this. It’s the leader’s job to keep that vision alive.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Expect some potholes.</strong> Change is hard, and rebranding is no exception. The more you can embrace the idea that challenges will be part of the process—and better yet, see them coming before anyone else does—the better shape you’ll be in. People will disagree, and the work might not be “it” the first time around. Rebranding is a process, and as a leader it’s your job to expect the challenges, understand them, and navigate through them.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Keep your passengers in the know.</strong> Communicating with everyone involved throughout the rebrand process is essential, especially because rebrands don’t happen overnight. Let folks know what the process will include, what’s happening next, and the status of everything. Don’t leave your passengers unengaged or lost.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Triage passenger feedback and politics.</strong> When it’s time to start making decisions and evaluating the work, it’s your job to listen to new ideas without judgment, take feedback seriously, and process what you’ve heard through the lens of the desired goals. Consider everything, but be comfortable knowing that not everyone’s opinions have to be included or have to be reflected in the final product. It’s up to you, as the leader, to decide and hold firm on what will (and what won’t) happen.</li>
<li><strong>Arrive safely at the destination.</strong> Ultimately, it’s your job as the driver on this journey to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road, and follow the smartest route possible. In a rebrand, you’ll have to ensure decisions are made, commit to those decisions, and make sure your team understands and supports those decisions. Some detours are okay, but a successful journey must come to an end.</li>

(I’m allowed to say this because I’m one of them!) As millennials make up more and more of the workforce and their buying power increases, organizations are obsessing about how to get them to care about their cause—and ultimately how to get them to give.</p>
<p>This obsession has led to tons of research about the generation, and after doing a little digging, I noticed that the research doesn’t always match up. For instance, MobileCause said <a href=""https://www.mobilecause.com/millennial-donations/"" target=""_blank"">millennials give to causes</a>, rather than specific organizations or brands, but Inc. 500 found millennials to be <a href=""http://www.inc.com/geoff-smith/millennials-becoming-more-loyal-in-era-of-consumer-choice.html"" target=""_blank"">extremely brand loyal</a> compared to other generations.</p>
<p>So what’s the deal? Do millennials care about a specific organization or not? And how does that affect their likelihood to give? Big Duck’s new market research tool, the <a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank"">Brandraising Benchmark</a>, also digs into questions like these, and our June survey returned some interesting results about young people:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>18-34 year olds had some of the highest levels of awareness</strong> of participating organizations. This means they were more likely than other, older age groups to claim that they’d heard of a participating organization. This was true for nonprofits large and small, and across a variety of sectors.</li>
<li>When asked about the importance of participating organizations’ mission statements, 18-34 year olds were <strong>more likely than any other age group to say the mission was very or extremely important</strong>. Again, true for nonprofits of all sizes and a variety of sectors.</li>
<li>When asked about their likelihood to donate in the future, 18-34 year olds were <strong>more likely than all other age groups to say they probably or definitely would donate</strong>. Again, true for organizations large and small, and across sectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>So perhaps all the obsession over millennials is warranted: they’re aware of what’s going on in the nonprofit sector and excited about donating. What’s more, they seem to be aware of specific organizations (not just the issues behind them), so they may pay more attention to your brand than you might expect.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway about all of this is that developing a brand that inspires connection is more important than ever. Think Nike or Old Spice, and think fast because this age group has a lot of organizations vying for their attention.</p>

In this article, Nicole Zacotinsky, an account manager at Ipsos, sheds light on three types of awareness worth considering. - Sarah.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is awareness and why is it important to measure?</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not people are aware of you is the foundation for any type of interaction with your organization. Measuring your awareness tells you where you stand, and repeating that measurement over time will tell you if your organization is increasing its awareness, decreasing it, or if it’s stagnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to understand a brand’s awareness, it needs to be measured with some type of frequency (monthly, yearly, bi-yearly, etc.). Your initial measurement becomes your benchmark or baseline, and as long as it’s measured in a similar manner (same questions among the same population) at the frequency you’ve determined, then upticks or downticks in awareness will show any impact your organization is having.</p>
<p>There will always be some “ghost awareness” (a % who claim awareness but aren’t actually aware) to some degree; however it is expected that the ghost awareness will remain consistent year on year. Therefore, the change in awareness year on year is much more important than a baseline awareness number and changes up or down in awareness trends that are are perceived to be real.</p>
<p><strong>There are three types of awareness</strong></p>
<p>There are three different types of awareness. There is prompted awareness: when asked, people tell you they know the organization when picking them off a list. There is unprompted awareness: when asked, people come up with the organization on their own without having to look at a list to say “Oh yeah, I know them.” And, as a subset of unprompted awareness, we have top of mind, meaning that when asked it is the first brand people tell you unprompted. The more you can get your target audience to come up with your organization’s name unprompted, the deeper the individual’s connection is to your organization. Being top of mind makes that connection even deeper. Brand awareness is important because the faster your nonprofit comes to mind, the easier it is to remember what it stands for and for a person to take action or donate.</p>
<p><strong>What do I do with my awareness measurement?</strong></p>
<p>The more your organization is able to put their name out there and drive awareness, the more your target population will show interest. You can put your organization’s name out there through social media buys, blog posts, and social events. A great example of this is ALS and the ice bucket challenge. They were able to raise $220 million in a year through a viral social media efforts. However you do it, ultimately the goal is to give them a reason to increase their share of wallet (donations) to you rather than another organization.</p>

We see a lot of organizations use the early months of a new year to set annual objectives in support of their strategic plan—it’s the perfect time to think through what you’d like to achieve in the coming year.</p>
<p>If your organization is about to embark on this—and if some of those objectives are related to communications—stop and think before you do. The Ducks have seen a lot of strategic and operational plans in our day. We’ve seen some that incorporate communications well, and others that miss the mark.</p>
<p>A crucial question to ask as you brainstorm communications (and other) objectives is: are they S.M.A.R.T.? Are they Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound?</p>
<p>Here’s a common example of a communications objective we see in strategic plans—and how we might adapt that objective to make it S.M.A.R.T:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Objective:</strong> Raise public awareness and strengthen name recognition of our work. </p>
<p>This objective forgets a few key elements of S.M.A.RT.:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It’s not specific: we generally discourage citing <a href=""/hello-general-public"" target=""_blank"">“the general public” as an audience</a>. It’s vague, which makes nailing down a strategy for reaching them pretty tough. We’d rather push this objective to define its audience by demographics, interests, philanthropic habits, etc.  </li>
<li>It’s not measurable: How are awareness and name recognition being measured? Is there a benchmark level of awareness against which to measure progress? This objective could use some specific metrics.  </li>
<li>It’s not time-bound: there’s no urgency to this objective—it could happen this year, next year, or never. It could use some time constraints.  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>S.M.A.R.T. Objective:</strong> Raise awareness of our work among millennials in the Northeast before the 2017 year-end season. We’ll measure success through a 10% increase (from 20% to 30%) in our level of awareness among this demographic.  </p>
<p>As you can see, this objective brings some specificity to the target audience and the timing, making it much easier to brainstorm how and when you might reach that audience. It also sets some benchmarks for success, which will help come year-end season, when it’s time to decide if the objective has been met.</p>

<p>Easier said than done, I know, but I’ve got an underused strategy for finding new donors: market research. While that phrase might just sound like expensive jargon to you, there are ways to use research to find out if you’re already targeting the right groups or if there are other people out there interested in giving to your cause.</p>
<p>Here are a few types of research your organization might consider—from simple to more sophisticated—to discover the characteristics of potential new donors:</p>
<p><strong>1. Survey your list yourself</strong></p>
<p>Send a quick survey to your email lists (donors, volunteers, etc.) and ask them a few simple questions. Get an idea of their demographics (age, gender, region, political affiliation, etc.) and ask if they plan on donating in the future. You can outsource this list modeling to firms who specialize in it too, but if that’s not realistic given your organization’s budget or your list size, this DIY approach can still help.</p>
<p>While the data from this research might confirm your current approach (for instance, that you’re correct in targeting women who are 55+), you might also see some interesting trends in other groups you haven’t spent much time trying to attract previously.</p>
<p><strong>2. Conduct external research</strong></p>
<p>While surveying or data-mining your own list can be helpful, it’s also useful to assess how people beyond your own audiences feel about your work. With market research typically costing $10,000 to $50,000 when customized, this has historically been something most organizations never do, or do only occasionally. That’s why Big Duck created <a href=""/brandraising-benchmark"" target=""_blank"">The Brandraising Benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>The Brandraising Benchmark is an affordable research tool that asks a sample of Americans how likely they are to donate to specific organizations in the future (among other things). It’ll also provide demographic insights to that question, so you can see if progressive women are more likely to give to you than progressive men, for example, or how people who live on the East coast view you compared to those who live in the South, and more.</p>
<p>After you’ve identified prospective new donor groups, try to learn a bit more about them. If you have previous donors (or even friends and family) that meet the profile of your new donors, do a bit of qualitative research (interviews, focus groups) to get at their motivations and barriers to giving. Informal interviews your staff conduct themselves can be powerful: they turn that abstract thing called “the donor” into a living, breathing person you can identify with and, therefore, communicate with much more powerfully. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you’ve collected all this information, go! Do! Try reaching some of these new groups, perhaps via list acquisitions or list swaps, and see if they have a good return on investment. While all this research may feel time-consuming, a more strategic approach to finding new donors will pay off in the long run.</p>

It’s just that those big numbers can be misleading.</p>","<p>This might sound radical to many fundraisers, but here’s my top recommendation for 2017: <strong>Stop looking at how much you raise.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been in the trenches of year-end fundraising for more than a decade now, and I’m not looking to take your hard fought wins away. It’s just that those big numbers can be misleading.</p>
<p>Staff and board politics will almost always require that you plug that big number into a Powerpoint or two and bring it up at some meetings, so that’s likely unavoidable.But if you really want to grow your fundraising program, you should let it go at that.</p>
<p>What you should be looking at instead is your <strong>percentage change, year over year.</strong> Here’s an example to illustrate why. Let’s say your year-end campaign finally hit the one million mark. That’s pretty exciting! But what if you raised $975,000 in 2015? One million minus $975,000…divided by…oh, that’s just a 3% increase. Not bad, but you’d think a lot differently about how your campaign performed when you look at it that way. (If you’ve been running a sizeable acquisition program, that increase may be kind of bad, but that’s another post.)</p>
<p>Looking at percent change rather than total raised means that you can see whether, at the end of the day, you’re really growing your program or more-or-less just maintaining the status quo. But if you’re just calculating the overall percentage change you’re still stuck on the totals. And the devil (and god) is in the details.</p>
<p>If you’re not seeing a breakdown by channels (online, offline) and mediums (direct mail, white mail, email, social, etc.), you may be missing big wins and losses. Let’s say you see an unimpressive overall percent change, but after breaking it down you see that direct mail decreased while online fundraising saw a huge increase. If you hadn’t looked at that, you would miss that your offline approach might need some TLC, and that it would likely be worth the time to dig into your online results until you understand what exactly drove such a great increase.</p>
<p>But here’s the big thing that way, way too many fundraisers miss: <strong>You need to look at large gifts separately from low-level donations.</strong> Let me use another name for large gifts: Outliers. Every organization receives gifts that are simply so large that they can significantly skew your results. And those donors don’t always come back next year.</p>
<p>Taking this step can be hard to swallow—we all want to take credit for the biggest increases possible. I’ve seen fundraising results go from showing a 57% increase to a 1.5% increase after just a single large gift was removed. Similarly large differences can easily be produced by a handful of $5,000 gifts. You might think twice before doubling down on your fundraising strategy after you see the percentage change with outliers removed.</p>
<p>The overall lesson? Beware of totals. It’s the change—and, more importantly, what changes—that matters.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","Avoid looking at the amount you raised","Calculate the percentage change change when determining how successful your year-end campaign was rather than looking at the money raised.","","follow the percentage","Fundraising Campaigns Donations","Fundraising Campaigns Donations donor gifts year end","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicmcphee/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to Nic McPhee's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""29"">Nic McPhee</a>&nbsp;(flickr)</p>

<p>The Alliance had just completed the Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak Center at Lakeside, an award-winning recreation center designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architect, and an infusion of good will and heightened fundraising had provided the resources to take on this project, and in short time and with an ambitious timeline, we kicked off work.</p>
<p>The project went smoothly and was overall a success, and I attribute this to several steps that were taken along the way:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Set a strategy</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>About a year before I came to the Alliance, the organization hired Big Duck to undertake a brandraising intensive &nbsp;with leadership and key stakeholders. This valuable process, which identified the Alliance's key audiences, its brand ""personality"" and the start of key messaging for the organization, served as a valuable strategic road map for our brand refresh and website redesign. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Consider the Brand History and equity</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For every organization, its history and focus for the future will dictate what direction to take with its brand identity. For the Alliance, we felt that its most recent brand identity, designed by Chermayeff &amp; Geismar in 2002, had resonance with our audiences, so rather than start from scratch, our designers built on that brand equity by streamlining and modernizing our existing mark, and introducing full brand system that played to our key brand characteristics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Build Consensus</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I am lucky to work in an environment with colleagues and leadership that were fully supportive of this project – this is not always the case. But even in the best situations, building consensus goes a long way toward ensuring the success of the project. From day one, I assembled a leadership team that was charged with making final decisions on the project, which met a key milestones in the project's development. In each phase of the project, the consultants met with key departments at the Alliance to gather their input and perspective. This not only ensured that the project went smoothly, but in my opinion also improved upon the design work.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Create a Full Brand System </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rather than just creating a logo and calling it a new brand identity, our designers fleshed out a full brand system, with our website as the first significant project. At the end of the project, we were provided with a font family, color palette, photography style guide, templates for creating the various types of print materials produced by the organization, letterhead, electronic newsletters, and even a system for branding all the work we do in Prospect Park. Consistency is incredibly important in establishing a brand and raising its profile, and this system was essential for our achieving these goals. Rather than restricting our designers, the new system has provided them with creative approaches for working within the system to produce strong and beautiful materials for our organization. </span></p>
<p>The results can be seen in the success of our marketing and fundraising activities – since the launch of our brand identity and website in late 2014, we have grown our email audience by nearly 200 percent, and have additional gains in our fundraising efforts with key audiences.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>This month, Brooklyn Community Foundation marks the third anniversary of </span><span>Brooklyn Insights</span><span>—an extensive Brooklyn-wide community engagement project launched shortly after our President Cecilia Clarke joined the Foundation, which ultimately produced a bold grantmaking strategy that </span><a href=""https://www.ncrp.org/initiatives/ncrp-impact-awards/past-ncrp-impact-awards-winners/brooklyn-community-foundation"" target=""_blank""><span>has since garnered national recognition</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And coincidentally, on this anniversary we are announcing the recipients of our new </span><a href=""http://www.sparkprize.org"" target=""_blank""><span>Spark Prize</span></a><span>—one of the Foundation’s highest-profile grantmaking efforts to date, awarding 5 outstanding Brooklyn nonprofits with no-strings-attached grants of $100,000 each in recognition of their service to Brooklyn, commitment to equity and justice, strong organizational values, and dynamic vision for the future.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While we’re often asked about the major themes surfaced through our </span><a href=""http://www.brooklyninsights.org"" target=""_blank""><span>1,000-plus </span><span>Brooklyn Insights’</span><span> community conversations</span></a><span>, the </span><a href=""http://www.brooklyncommunityfoundation.org/programs-impact/strategy"" target=""_blank""><span>core grantmaking strategies</span></a><span> we’ve since focused on, or our new institution-wide </span><a href=""http://www.brooklyncommunityfoundation.org/about/our-racial-justice-lens"" target=""_blank""><span>Racial Justice Lens</span></a><span>—in this blog, we’re going to focus on the set of values that emerged during </span><span>Brooklyn Insights</span><span> that not only helped the Foundation determine our new direction, but continue to guide us and inform new initiatives like the Spark Prize.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Of course, we knew three years ago that creating a community-led strategy might also lead us to change our mission statement and vision. But what we didn’t fully appreciate at the time was that while mission and vision are critical for moving us forward, strong institutional values are necessary to define who we are as an institution and how we hold ourselves accountable to these pursuits each and every day. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Over the six months of listening to Brooklynites tell us about the challenges they faced in their communities, the opportunities they saw for change, and the roles we as their Community Foundation could play, we also heard loud and clear a call for us to be a different kind of institution: one that wears its values on its sleeve, keeps the doors open, and always positions community voices at the fore of its work. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This call led us to articulate five new values for Brooklyn Community Foundation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Courage</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We believe in fearlessly identifying barriers to change and we fight for solutions that help overcome injustice.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Creativity</strong><span>. We believe that the power of imagination is greater than the challenges we face. We celebrate what works. We pursue the new. We learn as much from failure as we do from success.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Honesty</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are committed to being open and trustworthy in all we do and seek partners who share our values.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Collaboration</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We believe in creating solutions together, harnessing the diversity of Brooklyn, and partnering with the community to spark change and produce results.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Respect</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We believe in every resident’s dignity and basic human rights, and honor diversity of race, gender and background.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We’ve come to refer to these values at every test in our decision-making, we talk about them in our Board meetings, staff meetings, and annual staff reviews, and they’ve informed our ongoing racial justice and equity trainings. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And with the new Spark Prize, we are spotlighting the importance of strong values, and celebrating 5 Brooklyn nonprofits for their exemplary values-driven work. The first-ever recipients of the Spark Prize are </span><span><strong>Audre Lorde Project, Common Justice, Make the Road New York, MoCADA, </strong></span><span>and</span><strong> Neighbors Together. </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A committee of approximately 30 Brooklyn civic, business and philanthropic leaders (including Big Duck’s own Sarah Durham!) selected the 5 organizations from an applicant pool of over 150. They were chosen on the basis of a 1,000 word essay, followed by in person interviews where each spoke to the role their values play in their organization and how they align with the Foundation’s values.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In their application, </span><strong><a href=""http://alp.org"" target=""_blank"">Audre Lorde Project</a></strong><span> stated that their values are r</span><span>ooted in transparency, wellness, transformation, cultural work and coalition building.&nbsp;“Collaboration with other social justice organizations is central to ALP’s intersectional, movement-building work.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""http://www.maketheroad.org/"" target=""_blank"">Make the Road</a></strong><span> </span><span>wrote that their values are why their 19,000+ members shape all of their campaigns: “Our youth challenge oppression by naming the disparate treatment of black and brown, LGBTQ and immigrant young people …. Their passionate advocacy has resulted in huge movement victories.” </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""http://mocada.org/"" target=""_blank"">MoCADA</a></strong><span> </span><span>is</span><span> “</span><span>a museum</span><span> </span><span>founded on principles of justice, equity, and inclusion….courage, creativity and collaboration are the key elements of our mission, vision and values.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""http://neighborstogether.org/"" target=""_blank"">Neighbors Together’s</a></strong><span> work is</span><span> “</span><span>grounded in our belief in the dignity and potential of each person to be a vital part of creating a more just society” and its members have the courage “to fight for real and lasting solutions to overcome injustice.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And last but not least,</span><span> </span><strong><a href=""https://www.vera.org/centers/common-justice"" target=""_blank"">Common Justice</a></strong><span> </span><span>highlighted each of their values in their application—demonstrating a deep connection between their values and the unique nature of their healing work between victims and perpetrators of violence: </span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Accountability</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are responsible for our actions, our words, our power, and our impacts. We know that accountability affirms the dignity and humanity both of those responsible and of those harmed, and we hold ourselves to the same high standards to which we hold others.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Transparency</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are transparent about our actions, our intentions, our options, and our decisions. We communicate with clarity and consistency with those impacted by what we do.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Transformation</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We believe in the potential of all human beings to transform, heal, grow, change, and be resilient. We believe we all deserve individuals, communities, and institutions that support us in being our best selves.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Respect</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We believe in the inherent worth, importance, rights, culture, and strengths of all people, and work to reflect and honor that in the way we behave toward others.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Purpose</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We uphold the responsibilities and boundaries of our work because we are ambitious, hopeful, and outcomes-driven.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>These 5 values send a powerful message, and are a primary reason Common Justice is receiving the Spark Prize in our inaugural year. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As nonprofit communicators, we are all very familiar with the adage “Show, Don’t Tell.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Mission tells us what you do; values show who you are.</strong></p>

<p>For years, I’ve noticed that the majority of faces you see in most nonprofits belong to women. Beyonce got it right: women are the backbone of the social sector! They lead organizations, run departments, and power nonprofits at all levels. In fact, women make up most of the nonprofit workforce, yet despite that, we still occupy only a small percentage of the leadership slots at the top 400 charities. Sigh.</p>
<p>How can we change that? And what can you do to make sure one of those top nonprofit leadership seats is reserved for you?</p>
<p>I got together with <a href=""http://www.stetwin.com/"" target=""_blank"">Stephanie Thomas (of Stetwin Consulting)</a> and Adrienne Prassas (of NYU Wagner)-- both fundraisers par excellence-- to convene a pop-up event for AFP NY members about women’s leadership not long ago. A few dozen women participated, representing a diverse mix of ages, backgrounds, and nonprofit professional experience. Here are a few highlights from our discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering is a great way to develop your leadership skills.</strong> Want to transition into a career in international development? Build your skills in planned giving? Overcome your shyness at speaking in front of groups? Volunteer! Organizing or staffing an event, coordinating a committee, and other volunteer activities not only open up networks, they force you to work with new people in new situations.</p>
<p><strong>Tell them what you need to learn.</strong> Trying to break into a new area? Develop new skills? Tell your boss or your peers and colleagues what you want to learn, and offer to help out with projects that may be outside of your job description so you can build your skills. For instance, if you’re a grant writer but you want to get into major donor work, ask your boss if you can help them research and prep for a meeting, or listen in on a meeting or two.</p>
<p><strong>Be yourself.</strong> We talked a lot about the power of authenticity in building a strong reputation. Not sure what the answer is? Be honest about it. It’s good to stretch - but it’s not good to be something you’re not. Most of the experienced women at this event found their careers really took off when they spoke with their own voice, rather than trying to play a part they felt was expected of them.</p>
<p><strong>Show up.</strong> It’s easy to watch that webinar from your desk, follow along via social media in your jammies from home, and learn virtually. But when you show up at a conference, breakfast, workshop, or other event, the benefits are much greater. Get out and show up! You’ll make deeper, more meaningful connections faster.</p>
<p>Personally, I was deeply inspired by the younger women who participated, like Amalyah Oren, a young woman who works by day, volunteers by night, and writes a blog called the<a href=""http://thegivingkind.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank""> Giving Kind</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re building your leadership skills I’ll be participating in a panel on women’s leadership for the Foundation Center on March 7—<a href=""/leading-inclusively-panel"" target=""_blank"">details are online here</a>. I hope you can make it!</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1","Building blocks for women's leadership","Ways women can gain experience and grow into leadership positions in the nonprofit sector.","","women in nonprofits","Nonprofits leadership women","Women Nonprofit Sector Leadership","<p>Image from <a href=""https://www.pexels.com/photo/businesswomen-businesswoman-interview-meeting-70292/"" target=""_blank"">Pexels</a>.</p>",

Despite several alarming executive orders and appointees, it has been assuring to witness powerful and swift communications from nonprofit leaders of all types whose missions and values feel like they’re under attack (see Farra’s <a href=""/post-election-round-up"" target=""_blank"">round-up of nonprofit leaders responding to the election</a>). The fact is that the voices and actions of nonprofits are needed now more than ever, and it’s critical that organizations across all issues and areas seriously consider what role they can play in navigating through these uncertain political times.</p>
<p>Some nonprofits whose missions are under threat but also have powerful advocacy programs and robust communications teams appear well equipped to respond to these crises and take the lead in mobilizing supporters to take action. Within moments of a new piece of breaking news from the White House, it seems like organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood Federation of America have updated their websites with relevant content, urging their followers to take specific actions and donate. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most nonprofits aren’t in the same position of power and capacity as the ACLU or Planned Parenthood to respond. Many nonprofits have missions that will be impacted more tangentially (or perhaps not at all) by national policies and politics. It can be hard to know how and what to communicate—what the next tweet should be, what statement to issue, how urgent to sound, what action to request. And it can be tempting—especially in such stressful and emotional times—to dial up all your communications, responding to every news announcement or headline. But such a reactive approach can spiral out of control fast, lead you to inflate your connection to a particular issue, and is just unsustainable for most communications teams running with limited staff and resources.</p>
<p>Staying silent on current events that impact your communities may not be an option either. You might be perceived as out of touch, miss an opportunity to make a powerful statement about what you stand for, or leverage this moment for fundraising. What's the right communications approach for your nonprofit?</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas to help your nonprofit make decisions now:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brush up on your nonprofit’s guidelines for political activity: </strong>You probably already know if your nonprofit is a <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-501-c-3-tax-exempt-organization-how-do-we-apply-2502154"" target=""_blank"">501(c)(3)</a> or a <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-irs-classifies-nonprofit-organizations-2501798"" target=""_blank"">501(c)(4)</a>, but now is a great time to remind yourself of the rules and guidelines associated with both, especially some of the limitations of a 501(c)(3) when it comes to politics. They’re a little murky, so read carefully, and consult with knowledgeable staff or lawyers to confirm. Here’s a <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/can-nonprofits-engage-in-political-activity-2501879"" target=""_blank"">resource</a> to get the basics.</li>
<li><strong>Get aligned on your stance: </strong>Figuring out how your organization responds to the political fire should be a shared decision. Hold a meeting among primary communicators, senior staff, and key board members to discuss your organization’s approach as well as roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Review your key organizational and communications goals: </strong>Keep your organization’s primary goals in mind (fundraising? systems change? education? recruitment?), determine how communications support them,and who you need to engage most to reach those goals. Have these priorities shifted as a result of this election? Was advocacy more of a secondary goal that’s now more primary? How do the results of this election influence your ability to reach these goals?</li>
<li><strong>Consider your audience's point of view: </strong>Who are your audiences and what are their political views? Is your list made up of bleeding heart liberals? A mix of people from across the ideological spectrum? Craft your messages and actions with your audience's values and perspectives in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Know how you can uniquely contribute: </strong>What can your nonprofit contribute to the conversation that’s different from other groups (e.g. putting a spotlight on real voices, issue expertise)? Prioritize issues that are most important for you to weigh in on. Don’t bite off more than you can chew.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your brand in mind: </strong>It might be tempting to shift your organization’s tone and style now. But if you’re a social services organization and suddenly sound like a radical advocacy organization, it could be alarming and confusing to your audiences. Keep your tone in check and make sure you’re staying true to what your organization is all about. If your style is shifting, consider updating your brand’s voice alongside it. (We’ve got a brand check-up process that can help.</li>

When the right person applies to work for you and stays, spearheading game-changing communications projects year after year, you’ve hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Here are three ways you can hire and retain the best nonprofit communicators:</p>
<p><strong>Want a pro? Hire a pro.</strong> <br />It sounds funny to say, but if you want an expert communications director, you need to actually hire one. That often means resisting the urge to promote that programs person who you think is a good communicator just because they’ve worked at your org for awhile and “get it.” Try to avoid hiring that great person from the corporate world who comes without nonprofit experience too. Instead, recruit people with solid backgrounds working in nonprofit communications already so they can bring their knowledge of the sector, strategy, and skills with them.</p>
<p>Kivi Leroux-Miller and I recently collaborated on a study of successful in-house communications teams that revealed that hiring expert nonprofit communications professionals was a critical factor. (Download our ebook “<a href=""/5factors"" target=""_blank"">What it Takes to Be Great: The top five factors of successful nonprofit communications teams</a>” here).</p>
<p><strong>Big team? Invest in a strong second-in-command.</strong><br />I recently invited a handful of senior communicators at nonprofit organizations with operating budgets of 100 million dollars or more to meet each other over breakfast at Big Duck and share how their teams are structured. While each nonprofit’s communications team varied in size (from 1.5 to 14 full-time employees!) the directors in the room who seemed the happiest (and calmest) all had one thing in common: a strong second-in-command.</p>
<p>Senior-level communications pros don’t want want to do it all themselves, and they know it’s not a good use of donor dollars if they do. A strong Number Two gives your communications director the ability to step out of the weeds of managing every project, focus on setting priorities, and work more on the high-value projects. This generates greater value for the nonprofit, who’s likely paying that director a six-figure salary, and pushes down the day-to-day communications work to people who are less expensive, just starting their careers, and need to build these skills. It also provides your organization with a working succession plan if your director leaves.<br /> These Number Two spots are great opportunities to develop rising stars—and a more appropriate place for someone who’s entering your organization from the corporate sector or another department. They can be mentored by the Director while getting hands-on experience assuming management responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Lots to do? Set priorities and be ruthless.</strong><br />Communications teams have important strategic work to do: raising awareness, changing hearts and minds, engaging donors or members, recruiting participants to programs, strengthening the brand experience, and more. This work can take years to do successfully and well; it requires planning, budgeting, buy-in,methodical oversight, and execution.</p>
<p>At the same time, many communications teams also function as an internal agency. They are asked to create flyers for events at the last minute, help a department finesse and send an email out, and more to accommodate projects on short notice. This work is important too, but it’s often reactive and more tactical. It’s the sort of urgent (but not always important) work that eats up time from the important (but not always urgent) work of proactive, strategic communications.</p>
<p>That seasoned director you hope will build a nest for years to come will fly away fast if she’s burdened with an unreasonably long list of tasks, murky priorities, no resources for managing more production-based assignments, and left without time to advance the projects where she and her team might add the most value.</p>
<p>In our ebook, “<a href=""/5factors"" target=""_blank"">What it Takes to Be Great: The top five factors of successful nonprofit communications teams</a>,” we confirmed that successful communications teams rely not only on a clear set of priorities, but also the support of leadership who empowers them to be able to say no. At my roundtable of communications pros at large nonprofits there was consensus about this, too.</p>
<p>If priorities aren’t clear, consider labeling every project your department works on in one of these three ways:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Fire-extinguishing:</strong> these projects and tasks are typically urgent, time-sensitive, and often crisis-driven. They tend to be tactical and often have little or no long-term ROI. For example, fixing your board chair’s misspelled name on that big mailing you’re about to do.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Optimizing:</strong> these projects and tasks usually involve making processes, systems, and tools better. For instance, upgrading Constant Contact to something more state-of-the-art and powerful like Salesforce, or building a better website.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Seed-planting:</strong> these projects and tasks are the essence of important/not urgent work. They won’t bear fruit for some time, but when they do, you’ll feel great. For instance, researching and preparing a 3-year plan for your communications team that builds off of your organization’s strategic plan, includes a budget, and culminates by tackling a big project (such as a rebranding you know you should do but can’t happen soon).</p>
<p>Labeling these projects and tracking them in a project management system like Basecamp (or even on post-its on your wall) will help you get a clearer sense where your team’s time actually goes. Better yet, consider reviewing how many and what sort of fire-extinguishing, optimizing, and seed-planting projects you’re working on regularly with your boss so you can make sure you’re aligned.</p>

It helps organizations stand out from their peers, focuses fundraisers and other communicators on the messages they need to drive action, and provides the vision for a better future that inspires supporters to give.</p>
<p>A strong brand can also give you the edge you need to attract corporate donors. With <a href=""http://cecp.co/research/benchmarking-reports/giving-in-numbers-index.html"" target=""_blank"">$24.5 billion </a>donated by corporations last year, that’s no small consideration. Here are four ways that your brand can help support your corporate giving program:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1. <strong>Trust</strong><br />A clearly defined brand will help your organization generate stronger, more trusting relationships with your supporters, a key ingredient in building engaged communities. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs want to do good, but they also want to promote their own brand and connect with consumers. If your audience is highly engaged, corporate donors can feel confident that their support will get noticed. Because people like to support companies that do good, a recognized connection with your organization can help them build trust and find new, loyal customers within your community.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2. <strong>Reliability</strong><br />Corporate donors want to support good causes, but they also know that the nonprofit they choose to associate their brand with reflects back onto them. So, it is equally true that the values associated with a nonprofit brand will reflect on your corporate donors, and if your brand isn’t sufficiently professional or reliably expressed, you are starting at a disadvantage.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3. <strong>Clarity</strong><br />CSR programs operate based on defined philanthropic priorities, which are typically selected based on the causes’ affinities with the company’s business interests. For example, <a href=""https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/philanthropy/"" target=""_blank"">Disney’s</a> corporate citizenship program focuses on causes benefiting children. Other companies, like <a href=""https://www.google.org/global-giving/"" target=""_blank"">Google</a>, that focus on organizations using technology to combat a range of issues, can get fairly niche. Having a clear mission statement—which is a core piece of your brand identity—as well as key messages articulated in concise language will help you appeal to a CSR team.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.<strong> Personality</strong><br />Well-defined brands, whether nonprofit or corporate, express a clear personality that helps them to distinguish themselves. Corporations prefer to support organizations that align with their brand’s personality, so having a distinct personality that aligns with a corporate brand can make your nonprofit more attractive.</p>","","","a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:3:{s:2:""on"";s:2:""on"";s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:25:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:22169;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:21091;s:0:"""";i:21128;s:0:"""";i:21554;s:0:"""";i:22124;s:0:"""";i:22208;s:0:"""";i:22209;s:0:"""";i:22210;s:0:"""";i:22220;s:0:"""";i:22297;s:0:"""";i:22283;s:0:"""";i:22350;s:0:"""";i:22509;s:0:"""";i:22555;s:0:"""";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:26:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:21063;s:0:"""";i:21143;s:0:"""";i:21446;s:0:"""";i:21532;s:0:"""";i:21681;s:0:"""";i:21563;s:0:"""";i:21682;s:0:"""";i:21938;s:0:"""";i:22194;s:0:"""";i:22349;s:0:"""";i:22321;s:0:"""";i:22381;s:0:"""";i:22382;s:0:"""";i:22488;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}","","","a:1:{s:8:""smartcta"";a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:3:{s:2:""on"";s:2:""on"";s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:25:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:22169;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:21091;s:0:"""";i:21128;s:0:"""";i:21554;s:0:"""";i:22124;s:0:"""";i:22208;s:0:"""";i:22209;s:0:"""";i:22210;s:0:"""";i:22220;s:0:"""";i:22297;s:0:"""";i:22283;s:0:"""";i:22350;s:0:"""";i:22509;s:0:"""";i:22555;s:0:"""";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:26:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:21063;s:0:"""";i:21143;s:0:"""";i:21446;s:0:"""";i:21532;s:0:"""";i:21681;s:0:"""";i:21563;s:0:"""";i:21682;s:0:"""";i:21938;s:0:"""";i:22194;s:0:"""";i:22349;s:0:"""";i:22321;s:0:"""";i:22381;s:0:"""";i:22382;s:0:"""";i:22488;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}}","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1413%2","How strong brands attract corporate donors","Why having a strong brand can also give you the edge you need to attract other brands when it comes to corporate giving.","","driving corporate giving","fundraising corporate giving","fundraising corporate giving brand","<p>Image by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/117693452@N04/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to uberof202 ff's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""28"">uberof202 ff</a>&nbsp;(flickr)</p>

Your nonprofit is no different. We believe that defining and using your organization’s brand personality can be a useful communications tool. In fact, your personality, when coupled with your <a href=""/what-is-your-organizations-big-idea"" target=""_blank"">positioning</a> (the big idea you hope others might associate with your organization), is the heart of your brand strategy and the key to defining or refining your brand identity and experience.</p>
<p>First things first, what is brand personality? Brand personality is the tone and style you use to guide your communications. It is a set of adjectives that describe the overarching feelings you want your community to associate with your organization. Think about the most recent Target commercial you’ve seen and how it made you feel. You might describe the retail brand as fun, lovable, pleasant, and charming, and that’s brand personality in action.</p>
<p>Elements of your personality should come through in the tone and style of all of your communications. Writing a blog post? Designing a brochure? Check out the adjectives that make up your brand personality and decide if the communications look, feel, and sound true to your personality.</p>
<p>An effective brand personality will help your nonprofit distinguish itself from its peers because it’s a list of characteristics that are only true to you. Used consistently, personality will become a core part of your brand, and audiences will immediately associate certain feelings with your work.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? Imagine you were asking a board members to set your organization up on a blind date with their close friend, a generous potential donor. How would you want that board member to describe you to their friend? Sure, you hope they’d reference your mission or elevator pitch, but what adjectives would you want them to use to get that donor excited to meet you? Everyone would like a nice, professional, and credible organization, but what’s so special about you that someone couldn’t wait to meet you for dinner (or go to your next gala)?</p>
<p>I want to help you discover and apply your brand personality to your nonprofit. Join me on March 21 at this free 90-minute workshop, <a href=""http://grantspace.org/training/calendar/washington-dc/special-program-fish-or-fowl-establishing-your-nonprofit-s-brand-personality-2017-03-08-washington-dc#jmp_lnk"" target=""_blank"">Fish or fowl?

<p>Yearly disclaimer: We offer this list as a friendly guide towards making stronger, more thoughtful word choices in your everyday communications. What you find below may be the right—or only—choice at times, and that’s fine. But, with a little extra consideration, a much better word can almost always be used in its place.</p>
<p><strong>____-driven</strong><br />I’d love to be driven to as many places as I’ve seen services and programs described as “data-driven” or “research-driven.” Instead of suggesting influence, take your reader on the ride! What research shapes your programs? How exactly does data inform what you do?</p>
<p><strong>Untapped (potential)</strong><br />To describe individuals who have been excluded from resources, tools, or opportunities to succeed, the sentiment makes sense, but is vague and ubiquitous. The dictionary tells me that “untapped” is actually best used to describe natural resources that haven’t been exploited yet. I don’t think the true function of potential (or anything) is to be used up until it’s extinguished. What does your participants’ potential actually look like?</p>
<p><strong>Empower</strong><br />This word serves social, family, and feminist organizations exceptionally, but I feel uncomfortable about its implications. The idea of giving authority, opportunities, or dignity to people when they should (ideally) have access to those resources in the first place emphasizes the one who’s doing the giving (and owns the power). If your program is meant to help people learn enriching skills, cultivate confidence, or find mentorship, say so specifically.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting-edge</strong><br />Ow!</p>
<p><strong>Iterative</strong><br />If you look this word up in the dictionary, you’ll find a tautological definition, “relating to or involving iteration, especially of a mathematical or computational process,” which wouldn’t be an issue—if you were talking about a math problem. But this jargon comes up far too often in nonprofit context, and for what purpose? If a process, plan, or development is very complex or involves multiple trials, maybe it’s useful to talk about it in a way that’s less alienating.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive</strong><br />As a shortcut to say your organization does everything, comprehensive hurts more than helps. The idea of doing it all does a nonprofit little service in differentiating who they are. If you really are doing everything in your field, by all means, use this word, but please make sure it’s true first. Otherwise, define your objectives and mission clearly for potential participants, donors, and supporters so your audiences personally connect with your unique slice of the pie.</p>
<p><strong>A special tip: <a href=""http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/HyphensEnDashesEmDashes/faq0002.html"" target=""_blank"">Hyphens (-), en dashes (–), and em dashes (—) are not the same.</a></strong><br />This isn’t technically a word to avoid, but a lesson in clarity. The differences among these three lines are subtle, and when used improperly, don’t drastically change a sentence’s meaning, but please take note:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The hyphen (often improperly stylized -- as an em dash) should only be used to connect words that work together to form a single concept, such as “year-end” or “community-led.”&nbsp;</li>
<li>The en dash middle child connects things across distances like, January–March or 1994–2017.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use the em dash (—) to add a thought within a sentence—as I have attempted to do here (and be sure to close that thought with another em dash if it’s in the middle of a sentence).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">This level of grammatical detail isn’t absolutely necessary to get your message across, but will certainly ensure consistency and convey expertise.</p>
<p>That’s all for 2017, and I hope it helps. What words would you like to remove from office this year? We’d love to hear your nominations in the comments!</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1,1416%2,1409%3","Words to avoid for 2017","In our annual Words to Avoid post, find the words and phrases that nonprofit organizations should consider replacing with smarter, more interesting copy.

How do you respond to a donor who wants to know how the newest cabinet appointee will affect your work?

<li><strong>Proactive messaging:</strong> Is your mission directly affected because of political decisions being made? If so, your messaging might position you on the offensive—perhaps as specific talking points that address stances The White House is taking and what you’re doing to fight back. Here’s a simple framework for proactive messaging to help you get started:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Outline what your organization stands for</li>
<li>Address the threat posed by the new administration</li>
<li>State what you’re doing about it and why your work is needed now</li>
<li>Ask your community to take action</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><a href=""https://www.aclu.org/"" target=""_blank"">This ACLU example follows this framework, but simplifies it</a>—their homepage lightbox uses urgent language, takes a clear stance against Trump, and has a call to action. Another example is <a href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/center-science-and-democracy/stand-up-for-science-in-trump-administration#.WKyu-xIrKfU"" target=""_blank"">this webpage from Union for Concerned Scientists</a>—it takes a stance in support of science, highlights the risk posed by the new administration, and gives the community plenty of actions to take.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restructured messaging:</strong> If your mission isn’t directly affected by the changes happening in the Trump era, that doesn’t mean you can’t talk about it. Restructuring your current approach to messaging might be appropriate here—leaning on the messaging you already use, but framing it with the new administration in mind. Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates charities to guide intelligent giving, <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=4665"" target=""_blank"">recently posted this webpage of immigration and refugee organizations</a> in response to the controversial executive order. They tie in what they do (“making it easier for donors to identify highly rated charities”), but make it relevant to the political environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you’re scrambling to decide what to say about the political environment, look to your mission. Should you be proactive in your messaging? Or does it make more sense for you to simply reframe your current messaging in response to the new political environment?

Thoughtful timing makes a big difference in the experience and its outcomes, and can help make sure the right people are on the bus. But waiting too long can have very negative implications-- demotivating your staff and board, confusing your community, and creating a lackluster experience for donors and clients.</p>
<p>So if you know it’s a necessary step for your organization to take at some point, how do you <a href=""/timetorebrand"" target=""_blank"">determine the right time to tackle a rebrand</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Rebranding during times of predictable change</strong><br />Most nonprofits expect predictable moments of change such as the term-limiting of board members, the retirement of a CEO, or those that emerge from a long strategic planning or capital campaign process. Predictable change can be hard and scary, but because you saw it coming, time has hopefully been set aside to work on whatever is changing, and priorities have shifted in ways the whole organization acknowledges.</p>
<p>The rebrands that generate the best results for nonprofits typically happen right after a new leader joins the organization, strategic planning concludes, or just before a significant capital campaign.</p>
<p>Rebranding during these moments is more effective because leadership views the work as one of several changes essential to the organization’s growth and development, so there’s real commitment to see it through. Our national study of the impact rebranding has on nonprofits, “The Rebrand Effect”, showed that these organizations seem to raise more money, attract better board members, recruit more program participants, and motivate their staff more, too. (<a href=""/rebrandeffect"" target=""_blank"">You can download the ebook about that study here</a>.)</p>
<p>Conversely, rebranding before a significant change in leadership can less effective, or even die on the vine entirely. A new Executive Director, Chief Development Officer, or Communications Director who inherits a rebrand they weren’t a part of has less investment in its success, or may not like it at all. Without senior-level support and a champion, the new brand is likely to be implemented less consistently and ineffectively. That’s a real waste of time and money.</p>
<p>We recommend you wait for the key players to join your senior leadership team so they can be a part of the rebrand, if you know that change is coming within a year. They’ll be more likely to understand, leverage, and promote it if they are a part of the new brand’s creation.</p>
<p>Its also best to wait until your strategic planning process is well underway and the future direction of the organization is clear before rebranding. Your rebrand is simply an extension of that plan: the two should, ideally, feel closely intertwined.</p>
<p><strong>Rebranding during times of unpredictable change</strong><br />While predictable changes can feel hard as you’re going through them, it’s the changes you didn’t see coming that can feel the most disruptive within an organization. Political changes alter the fundraising landscape. A crisis in your community shifts programmatic priorities overnight. The sudden departure of an executive director or other key staff person leaves you shocked… you get the point. These unpredictable changes inside and outside your nonprofit can stir up anxiety for staff, board, and your closest advocates. They eat up brainspace and energy you weren’t prepared for.</p>
<p>When you’re already stretched thin, rebranding is harder because it requires real time, focus, and effort. If the changes aren’t likely to impact the engine that powers your work such as your fundraising and client-facing programs, waiting until you have the brainspace and energy for it as an organization may be the best plan. But if your funding sources are changing and you anticipate needing to build new relationships with individual donors or corporate supporters then it’s a mistake to wait too long, as you’ll want to establish your voice as effectively as possible. Don’t put off rebranding if it’s clearly an essential step toward building relationships that will be critical to your success or survival downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Timing</strong><br />A smart rebranding process begins by creating or refining assets that express your nonprofit’s vision, mission, and voice in powerful ways. Next, you’ll weave those elements into your website, social, print, in-person, and other materials. Finally, you’ll integrate it consistently into fundraising, awareness, recruitment, and other campaigns that reach and engage your audiences. That’s how household brands do it, and it takes time and consistency to do well. Start your rebrand before there’s a crisis or problem, if possible, so you don’t cut corners to get it done. After all, you’ll want it to last.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself these three questions</strong><br />Still not clear what you should do? Use these questions to guide a conversation about whether or not this is the right time to rebrand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are we clear and aligned about where our organization is heading over the next few years so we can use that to inform our brand strategy, visuals, and messaging?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is it likely that our Executive Director and any senior staff responsible for communications will be with the organization for at least a year to see this process through and <a href=""/organizational-strategy-and-clear-communications-goals"" target=""_blank"">help make it stick afterwards</a>?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is now a time when we should be investing in our own infrastructure and future so we can build relationships in a year or beyond with new donors, funders, clients, partners, or other key external audiences we might not be reaching effectively yet?</li>
</ol>
<p>This <a href=""/timetorebrand"" target=""_blank"">information visualization</a> might help you decide, too. Lastly, it might also be useful to reach out to other organizations that have rebranded and learn from them. When and why did they do it? What were the benefits and challenges?</p>
<p>Rebranding alone doesn’t raise awareness for your organization, it just gives you the tools to do so more effectively. A successful rebrand brings your organization’s vision and mission to life through a clear communications strategy, messaging, and visuals framework that staff and board can use to communicate consistently and effectively. Your staff will be able to speak, write, campaign, and engage people more powerfully, and in ways that reflects the essence of your vision and mission. Time it right to get the best value.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1066%1,1067%2","When should your organization rebrand?","It might seem hard to focus on longer-term strategies like branding right now, but it’s critical to not lose sight of the big picture and continue to lay a strong foundation for growth, even during uncertain times.

American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a large Quaker organization that promotes lasting peace with justice, as a practical expression of faith in action, figured out how to do this with amazing results. A cultural anthropologist and self-proclaimed data nerd, Beth Hallowell conducts research to understand how people view the issues that AFSC works on as well as how they’re covered in the media. Her title is Communications Research Director, and she’s a key member of a large communications team that largely supports AFSC’s programs. Beth’s role is fairly unique from what I’ve seen but it’s one that adds enormous value. In this blog, I interviewed Beth to learn more about her work and how nonprofits of any size can leverage research in their work more effectively even if a full-time staff position isn’t likely. - Sarah Durham</em></p>
<p><strong>What are the day-to-day responsibilities of a Communications Research Director? </strong><br />My core areas of work are audience research, media analysis, messaging research, and monitoring and evaluation for comms – plus managing my team, grant-writing to make sure we stay in business, and continuously learning more myself about how to do this kind of work. Today, for example, I spent the morning pulling together the results of our most recent media analysis on Islamophobia in the news for our anti-Islamophobia campaign’s media strategy; brainstormed with my supervisor about how to package the results of a new messaging study that we have coming out in late March; scheduled time to work on an LOI for our next foundation funding prospect; edited a post that one of my interns wrote for our blog; and attended a webinar by the CMO of IDEO to learn more about how the big kids are implementing design thinking for marketers.</p>
<p><strong>How does the work you do in the communications department impact other departments (i.e., programs or development)?</strong><br />My job typically starts with a problem that program staff are having – often, because they’ve been trying to move people to action for a long time but they don’t feel like they’ve been making much progress. They come to me to help them figure out why constituents aren’t taking action, or why it seems like their messages just aren’t getting through. For example, a few years ago when ISIS started posting gruesome videos online, AFSC’s programs to decrease military spending all of sudden found that their messages were falling on deaf ears. They’d made a lot of progress in their messaging during the draw-down in Iraq and Afghanistan, but as those videos started showing up and ISIS garnered more media attention, they increasingly found that their previously war-weary audiences were now scared and were no longer supportive of decreased military spending.</p>
<p>That’s where we came in.</p>
<p>We started by doing a media analysis to pin down the messages our audiences were hearing about violent extremism in their daily lives. The results were worse than we expected: For example, one of the main messages people were hearing from mainstream media was that violent extremism requires military action, that Islam is almost always linked to extremism, and that there really aren’t nonviolent ways (like diplomacy) to solve this kind of problem.<a href=""https://www.afsc.org/mixedmessages"" target=""_blank""> You can read all about our findings here</a>. We are currently in the next phase of this research: Given what we know about what our audiences are hearing, what messages will be most effective in countering Islamophobia? What messages will most effectively promote inclusive communities? Once we have this data, we’ll use it to guide our own content on this issue as well as share it with our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, you led the research for AFSC’s new report <a href=""http://afsc.org/mixedmessages"" target=""_blank"">“Mixed Messages: How the Media Covers ‘Violent Extremism’ and What You Can Do about It.”</a> What were the findings?</strong><br />We found that 90 percent of the time, news stories about extremism mention Islam, even in several cases when Muslims aren’t involved. They cover violent responses to conflict five times more than they cover nonviolent responses. This means that media coverage paints a picture for U.S. news consumers that links Islam to extremism—and extremism to violent conflict and military intervention. If this is the story that people see every time they turn on the news, it’s no wonder that Islamophobia and support for military intervention in the Middle East are both on the rise, as we’ve seen in public opinion polls.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to a CEO or Executive Director who is considering creating a position like this?</strong> <br />This position helps achieve an organization’s mission by using data to take its communications to the next level. That’s my elevator pitch to anyone in the C-suite looking to get more out of their marketing efforts. At AFSC, our mission is to promote lasting peace with justice. Communications research has helped achieve that goal by providing guidance to program staff and the communications team on who our audiences are as actual humans, what they want, what messages work best for them and why, messaging pitfalls to avoid, and how well we’re doing as a team and an organization in terms of growing our digital engagement with our constituents.</p>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of nonprofit organizations that might benefit from a Communications Research Director?</strong><br />Any organization that wants to move an audience to do something can benefit from communications research. Content creators at many organizations usually have a working understanding of what kinds of content work for their audiences – through trial and error for example, or by watching analytics. But with a Communications Research Director, you get a person whose full-time job is to test assumptions about who the audience is and what they care about; look for opportunities to improve messaging and find the most effective directions for doing so; and evaluate communications performance from a 360-degree perspective.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for organizations that are interested in using research more, but can't dedicate a position to it?</strong><br /><a href=""https://www.afsc.org/blogs/media-uncovered"" target=""_blank"">Read our blog</a>! Especially if you work on social justice issues – we want to share our results as widely as possible, and that’s our main platform for doing so. We try to make our findings user-friendly, so that anyone could apply them. I’d also recommend the wonderful resources at the <a href=""http://www.opportunityagenda.org"" target=""_blank"">Opportunity Agenda</a> – my position wouldn’t exist without their thought-leadership on the role of communications in social justice movements. If you’re interested in learning more about your own audience – or evaluating how your own communications are doing – but have no budget, then I’d recommend setting up a calendar reminder to do 3 things every quarter or so:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Talk to at least one internal person about how your comms are working</li>
<li>Talk to at least one external person (a constituent, a donor) about how your comms are working, and</li>
<li>Check basic analytics (i.e. Google analytics and maybe the analytics of 1-2 key social platforms).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Anyone on your team with 1 hour per quarter can do this and report back to you, or you can do this yourself as long as you make the time. At a minimum this will help you avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. It will also help you begin to build a culture of continuous learning.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Communications Research Director position fit into the overall structure of your organization?</strong> <br />I lead a team with two full-time researchers (myself and an analyst), and we typically have 2-3 volunteer interns - Philly is full of colleges, so we created an internship aimed at students looking for experience with applied research/analytics/marketing. Our team is in the Communications Unit, and my supervisor is AFSC’s Communications Director. The Comms Unit is a crossroads for our very diffuse organization – we have over 70 programs in more than 30 locations worldwide – which is great because it gives me the opportunity to work with staff around the world. I’ve worked with staff from Denver to Iowa to the Middle East to North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>Has the current political environment affected communications research at AFSC? </strong><br />It’s increased the urgency of what we do. The stakes of getting our message right the first time – by knowing our audience as best we can so we can engage them as quickly and as effectively as possible – are the highest they’ve been since I started with AFSC in 2014. We need to learn faster so that we can move faster, pivot faster, mobilize faster – and more effectively. That’s what my job is about now – the day-to-day tasks and skills haven’t changed, but the stakes are higher. I think it’s really important that even though we’ve been in rapid response mode for a while now, we aren’t just reacting to the current environment: Instead, we are building on what we’ve learned and we’re still doing what we need to do to learn more and improve as we go.</p>

Right now in the nonprofit sector, political conversations also permeate the work day—because the mission of a particular organization may be directly impacted by current events, or simply because the nonprofit field leaves more room for the passion of politics than the private sector, where it’s more common to leave your affiliations and opinions at home</p>","<p>Everyone’s talking politics these days—all day, every day. At home, and definitely at work. Right now in the nonprofit sector, political conversations also permeate the work day—because the mission of a particular organization may be directly impacted by current events, or simply because the nonprofit field leaves more room for the passion of politics than the private sector, where it’s more common to leave your affiliations and opinions at home. Many nonprofits have also made public statements, or are working as an organization on specific mission-related actions (<a href=""http://www.jtsa.edu/human-dignity-and-lgbtq-rights-a-statement-by-the-jewish-theological-seminary"" target=""_blank"">check out this statement on human dignity and LGBTQ rights from the Jewish Theological Seminary, for example</a>). But how do politics integrate into the individual’s workday, especially now that we’re living and breathing breaking news? Let’s face it—what’s going on is critically important—but engaging with it constantly is distracting!</p>
<p>These days it feels unrealistic and unmotivating to encourage confining the “meet you at the rally” talk to after-work hours. Further complicating the issue is the fact that folks—no matter their political bent—may feel uncomfortable, or demotivated by the constant barrage of news. So how do you set boundaries in order to stay productive and engaged with work, not make anyone else uncomfortable, and still be involved politically?</p>
<p>Here are some ideas (most of which we’re implementing at Big Duck) to thoughtfully and strategically make space for politics at an individual level at your nonprofit.</p>
<p><strong>Do you use an instant messaging platform like Slack or Hipchat? Make a political room.</strong><br />Create a space for staff to motivate each other to participate in upcoming protest events, call legislators’ offices, and fight back. Removing these types of conversations from actual work dialogue also allows staff to focus when they’re trying to dive deep, so you have the best of both worlds—productivity and political action!</p>
<p><strong>Schedule an optional weekly brown bag lunch or after-hours meet-up to vent, debate, and or incubate ideas for your nonprofit to get involved.</strong><br />Planning a lunch or meet-up gives staff a collaborative outlet to bring their thoughts, ideas, and opinions to the table. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and alone with the daily inundation of political media, and connecting with peers can offer some mental relief and could produce a constructive plan for your organization to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Use an anonymous poll to gauge how comfortable the staff is.</strong><br />Before introducing new initiatives or sharing too much, get a temperature read on staff opinions first. The idea of getting politically active now in areas your organization may not have been engaged in before could evoke some thoughts and fair concerns from staff members, especially those who don’t share the majority point of view. An anonymous poll lets staff present their perspectives without judgment and allows you to make informed decisions on how your nonprofit should communicate internally.</p>
<p><strong>Have a best practices brainstorm with staff on how to stay motivated and mission-focused.</strong><br />Maybe it’s turning off alerts on your NYT app so that you don’t break focus at work. Or maybe it’s scheduling time to call your senator on your lunch break… use your collective brains for ideas on how to turn off the noise and focus on work, while making room for the political engagement that’s important to you.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your board is on board.</strong><br />If you’re a nonprofit with a hands-on board, or a nonprofit that’s politically oriented, your leadership team and board will likely have something to say about using official work channels for politics. Run your ideas by your executive director to make sure internal initiatives don’t ruffle any feathers.</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","18910%1","Balancing political conversations at work","","","productivity and politics","Productivity","Productivity polititics trump bigduck","<p>Image adapted from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/lamdogjunkie/"" class=""owner-name truncate"" title=""Go to lamdogjunkie's photostream"" data-track=""attributionNameClick"" data-rapid_p=""29"">lamdogjunkie</a>&nbsp;(flickr)</p>

There are tons of ideas out there for making your campaign a success, but Big Duck has one tried and true strategy that you’ll see in most every campaign we work on: a concept.</p>
<p>A campaign concept ties together all elements of a campaign—it’s a hook or idea that convinces your audience that now is the time to take action. Concepts give your audiences something to care about and a message to get behind. Without them, audiences might not understand what action you’re asking them to take or why.</p>
<p>Chances are you see campaign concepts in action all the time. Here three examples illustrating how we’ve used concepts to inspire action in our work:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Math for America</strong>: This program providing fellowships for public school science and math teachers used a concept, <a href=""/math-for-america-teacher-recruitment"" target=""_blank""><em>Practice What You Teach</em></a>, for their recruitment campaign. The concept is woven into the slogans and design to inspire action from their target audience: smart, passionate educators. This concept went multi-channel: from subway posters to education magazines, there’s a consistent look, feel, and message across all their campaign communications.    </li>
<li><strong>City Harvest</strong>: A nonprofit spearheading food donation and distribution programs across New York, City Harvest had seen substantial success with their annual fundraising campaign, <em>Skip Lunch Fight Hunger</em>. They came to us with even greater fundraising goals and we shook up their landmark concept with a fresh new concept—<a href=""/recruitment-and-fundraising-campaign-to-feed-nyc-kids"" target=""_blank""><em>The Power Lunch</em></a>—capturing their energy, urgency, and inspiring New Yorkers across platforms to transform their lunch money into an investment against hunger.   </li>
<li><strong>New York School of Interior Design</strong>: A solid brand identity should always carry over into campaign initiatives. Big Duck updated NYSID’s brand and extended it into the concept&nbsp;<em><a href=""/branding-to-boost-enrollment-at-art-school"" target=""_blank"">Turn your Creativity into a Career</a><a href=""/branding-to-boost-enrollment-at-art-school"" target=""_blank""></a></em> to help NYSID to stand out to prospective students and increase applications for enrollment. Positioning the school as the place for emerging designers to find or change careers, their new brand transformed (and reinforced) the look and feel of their annual recruitment campaign concept, motivating students to apply.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Next time your organization is planning its next big fundraising, recruitment, or advocacy campaign, remember to stop and think about a concept. Spend some time brainstorming what might grab the attention of your audiences and how that might play out across your communications channels.</p>","","","a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:3:{s:2:""on"";s:2:""on"";s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:25:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:22169;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:21091;s:0:"""";i:21128;s:0:"""";i:21554;s:0:"""";i:22124;s:0:"""";i:22208;s:0:"""";i:22209;s:0:"""";i:22210;s:0:"""";i:22220;s:0:"""";i:22297;s:0:"""";i:22283;s:0:"""";i:22350;s:0:"""";i:22509;s:0:"""";i:22555;s:0:"""";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:27:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:21063;s:0:"""";i:21143;s:0:"""";i:21446;s:0:"""";i:21532;s:0:"""";i:21681;s:0:"""";i:21563;s:0:"""";i:21682;s:0:"""";i:21938;s:0:"""";i:22194;s:0:"""";i:22349;s:0:"""";i:22321;s:0:"""";i:22381;s:0:"""";i:22382;s:0:"""";i:22488;s:0:"""";i:22576;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}","","","a:1:{s:8:""smartcta"";a:9:{i:10;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""10"";s:2:""id"";i:10;}i:20;a:3:{s:2:""on"";s:2:""on"";s:2:""vo"";s:2:""20"";s:2:""id"";i:20;}i:90;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""30"";s:2:""id"";i:90;}i:30;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""40"";s:2:""id"";i:30;}i:40;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""50"";s:2:""id"";i:40;}i:60;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""60"";s:2:""id"";i:60;}i:70;a:2:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""70"";s:2:""id"";i:70;}i:26010;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""80"";s:5:""items"";a:25:{i:1267;s:0:"""";i:20188;s:0:"""";i:20206;s:0:"""";i:20248;s:0:"""";i:20381;s:0:"""";i:20382;s:0:"""";i:20449;s:0:"""";i:20817;s:0:"""";i:20898;s:0:"""";i:22169;s:0:"""";i:20957;s:0:"""";i:21091;s:0:"""";i:21128;s:0:"""";i:21554;s:0:"""";i:22124;s:0:"""";i:22208;s:0:"""";i:22209;s:0:"""";i:22210;s:0:"""";i:22220;s:0:"""";i:22297;s:0:"""";i:22283;s:0:"""";i:22350;s:0:"""";i:22509;s:0:"""";i:22555;s:0:"""";i:1266;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:26010;}i:80;a:3:{s:2:""vo"";s:2:""90"";s:5:""items"";a:27:{i:20400;s:0:"""";i:20380;s:0:"""";i:20439;s:0:"""";i:20763;s:0:"""";i:21063;s:0:"""";i:21143;s:0:"""";i:21446;s:0:"""";i:21532;s:0:"""";i:21681;s:0:"""";i:21563;s:0:"""";i:21682;s:0:"""";i:21938;s:0:"""";i:22194;s:0:"""";i:22349;s:0:"""";i:22321;s:0:"""";i:22381;s:0:"""";i:22382;s:0:"""";i:22488;s:0:"""";i:22576;s:0:"""";i:1823;s:0:"""";i:20179;s:0:"""";i:19614;s:0:"""";i:19949;s:0:"""";i:19712;s:0:"""";i:19836;s:0:"""";i:20031;s:0:"""";i:20379;s:0:"""";}s:2:""id"";i:80;}}}","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","1405%1,1413%2","Boost your campaign's awareness with a concept","Campaign concepts help to tie together a campaign so that it looks and feels consistent and helps audiences understand what action they’re taking and why.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>","<p>Over the past 15 years (or so) the media and our habits of consuming information have helped to produce a world of <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/trump-news-media-ignore.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">seemingly inescapable</a>, fast-paced echo chambers. Now enter 2017, and controversy and scandal are driving a never ending media frenzy.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is going to settle into permanent new-normal status, it is worth pausing to revisit a question nonprofit communicators have been obsessing over since at least the turn of the century: How do I get my message out amidst all this noise?</p>
<p>Here are some strategies for getting heard in a period with lots of distractions:</p>
<p><strong>Repeat and reinforce your campaigns</strong> <br />If you’re worried that your audience may not be paying as much attention as they normally would, few tactics are as helpful as repetition. Packaging your key messages and initiatives into campaigns of strategically timed communications that reinforce each other across channels and over a series of messages will go a long way toward driving action and making a lasting impression. This means including all of your active channels, from direct mail to SMS, in your campaigns, repetitive use of the same images and basic messages across channels, and timing your various components to launch in short succession.</p>
<p><strong>Plan strategically, but be flexible</strong><br />Recently the only thing that’s predictable is that big, attention-getting surprises will keep on coming. In this context, you need to keep planning your communications strategically and methodically based on when your message is likely to resonate, the messages your audience responds to, etc. At the same time, prepare yourself for the unexpected. Often you need to stick to the plan and roll with the punches—and you shouldn’t be overly reactive. But at times it’s smart to make small changes to your schedule or messaging. For example, we knew in advance that <a href=""/wildlife-organization-fundraising"" target=""_blank"">Conservation International</a>’s 2015 year-end fundraising campaign would have to be responsive to the UN climate talks in Paris. We were lucky to know roughly when outcomes would be released, and built wiggle room into our schedule as a result. And because we didn’t know for sure what the results would be, we explored various scenarios when writing campaign content so we would be ready with the right messaging and tone when the announcement came.</p>
<p><strong>Shift toward the public mood</strong><br />If you haven’t done so recently, take a moment to consider what your nonprofit’s personality is. Is there an aspect of your work that feels most relevant to current events? Can you adjust your tone in a way that aligns with content your audience is consuming right now, while still sounding like you? Or, you may be able to adopt language that reflects cultural trends—for example, talking about your work in terms of movement building or using advocacy language like “take action” in response to today’s political climate. One organization that has done this recently is <a href=""https://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/"" target=""_blank"">Sanctuary for Families</a>, a domestic violence organization that serves a largely immigrant population in New York. As advocacy has always been part of their work, Sanctuary’s communications have long included bold language. But, as the president’s executive orders on immigration, they’ve leaned into this aspect of their voice in a way that communicates their passion in the face of a political environment that is hostile toward the community they serve. Showing your audience that you know what they care about is a great way to build stronger relationships—and, if your content or tone relates to where your supporters’ heads are at, they will be primed to pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>Go to the unexpected</strong><br />Another strategy is to purposely contradict with your audience is thinking about or how they’re feeling. Imagine this: An environmental organization sends you an email tomorrow with the subject line, “The earth is smiling today.” You open the email, and find a message that addresses the three-year plateau in carbon levels your support helped achieve, then asks you to donate to make sure we can fight back against climate deniers. The seemingly dissonant subject line would get people’s attention, and supporters may even take solace in and appreciate the positive part of the message.</p>
<p><strong>Up the volume</strong><br />As the number of marketing messages we’re bombarded with every day grows and grows, you’re going to need to do more to get your supporters’ attention. That may mean increasing the frequency of your ongoing communications, creating new campaigns, or adding additional components to existing campaigns—increasing the number of emails or social posts, adding a lightbox, investing in paid advertising, etc. Many organizations are hesitant to communicate more out of fear of annoying their supporters, but generally nonprofits don’t communicate as much as they could. In my time working in nonprofit communications (and I’m old enough that it’s been a while), I’ve never seen a notable negative response to an increase in communication. I’ve even seen the opposite—for example, one Big Duck client who’s found that their unsubscribe rates on emails have gone down as we have increased the number of appeals! <br /> <br />On a different note, if you’re also responsible for your nonprofit’s year-end fundraising I’ll be leading a brief webinar on emerging trends from 2016 fundraising.

<p>What would be different at your organization if you viewed communications as an essential, universal strategic function instead?</p>
<p>Thinking of marketing or communications as just a series of externally-facing tactics can be a big missed opportunity, because most of the power of smart communications happens behind the scenes—infusing your entire team of stakeholders with the skills and tools to express a consistent, coherent voice.</p>
<p>Every person who works for your organization is a communicator on some level, whether they’re building partnerships with peers or relationships with participants or connections with advocates or rapport with potential hires. They need tools and strategic support to work at the top of their communications game, just like they need a computer that boots up properly in the morning and lights that turn on when they walk into the office.</p>
<p>So what if we thought beyond the websites and brochures and instead treated communications as a key utility underpinning every aspect of a nonprofit’s work and mission? <br />What if everyone at your organization looked to your in-house communications team for helpful, expert advice on getting the word out or inviting the world in? <br />What if programs, development, HR, board, and leadership could all reach out to one, centralized resource for strategic messaging points or insights about how to engage a key audience?</p>
<p>It would be transformative.</p>
<p>Everyone’s efforts would become more efficient and effective. Your programs team would have better tools to recruit and advance your mission. Your board would become more effective ambassadors. You would develop close alignment between what you do, what you say, and how you say it.</p>
<p>And once you’ve made sure your messages, visuals, and strategies all ladder up to and support your organization’s most critical priorities, you could step back and watch the clarity and focus flow through the communications team to every corner of your organization and out into the world.</p>
<p>I’m not pretending it’s easy work.</p>
<p>Assembling a skilled, well-structured team and evolving a culture that treats communications as the lifeblood of your organization is challenging and requires real investment. But wouldn’t it be worth it if you could make clear, effective external communications feel as simple and magical as turning on a light?</p>","","","","","","","Blog Post","blog_post","Project","project","Workshop/Webinar","workshop","Project","project","0","2059%1","Communications as an essential piece of your org","It’s easy to think of communications as just the stuff you can see—the enewsletters and the press releases and the Facebook posts.

<p>“At Big Duck we tend to start working on the year-end season with our clients in September or August. Our philosophy is that it's never too early to start planning for year end. We'll also talk about tactics that are becoming more and more common, and specific ways to increase your fundraising. What we looked at—just so you don't think that we pulled this out of thin air—during December of 2016 I spent time looking at 120 of the best nonprofits on the web.<br /> <br />Going to <a href=""https://topnonprofits.com/"" target=""_blank"">TopNonProfits.com</a>, this is an organization that maintains a lot of really great lists that are great resources to see what other organizations are doing. I went through the top 100 nonprofits on the web as well as the 20 best nonprofit websites, 2016 edition. In addition, I of course looked through a lot of email at year-end time. Like most of us, especially in a nonprofits space who are following a lot of different organizations in addition to donating to the organizations that we care about, I received a very high number of emails at the holiday season and learned a lot by looking through those.<br /> <br />So, why are we here? This question may feel fairly obvious to most of you, but it does deserve addressing. Of course, online fundraising is increasing every year at a decent pace. It’s still pretty far behind direct mail in terms of the percentage of funds that your program likely accounts for, but as direct mail slows down and starts to decrease, then online becomes more and more important, that trend is eventually going to reverse itself.<br /> <br />There is the factor, of course, that if we are focusing on year-end, we have to acknowledge that 29% of giving occurs in December, with 11% of giving occurring in the last three days of the year. This is a stat from <a href=""http://www.networkforgood.com/"" target=""_blank"">Network for Good</a>, and just to note, this is the 2015 stat. Network for Good has not yet released 2016 numbers, but I do expect that the numbers will be roughly similar. Also, we should note that these are online numbers, but we do know that offline can be following a similar track.<br /> <br />Talking about trends, a few to consider: The people want mobile. Now if any of you attended this webinar—the version of this webinar that I gave last year—you'll remember that this something we talked about then. This is one of those things that every single year we're going to be talking about—the increase in the influence of mobile. It only accounts right now for 17% of online giving, but as you can see here, the percentage just keeps on rising and rising.<br /> <br />Like in many cases, especially in the online world, the nonprofit world is lagging just behind e-commerce. E-commerce and the not-for-profit world is always a bit more advanced than nonprofit for a number of reasons. Just for a point of comparison, if Q4 of 2015, 17% of e-commerce happened on mobile devices and in Q4 of 2016 it was 21% on mobile devices. Nonprofits being a bit behind, part of the reason for that is that most likely, while many, many people will visit your website on a mobile device, the percentage of web traffic that have it on mobile versus desktop is a lot higher once they decide to give or take some action, a lot of people migrate to desktops.<br /> <br />That said, probably a good chunk of those people are migrating to desktops because they do not experience a good donation process on a mobile device. They get to a form, it does not feel friendly, so on a so forth. This is another argument for making the point to improve your mobile fundraising process. Improve the mobile presence for your organization so that you can get closer to the e-commerce end of the spectrum.<br /> <br />Also, we're seeing over time more and more nonprofit organizations are investing in digital advertising. Of course, the most common form of digital advertising for a nonprofit organization is a Google ad where at the end ad which nonprofits received Google grants for. I believe that typically a Google grant for their SEM platform is $10,000 a month, so free money to the advertising online. Never a bad idea to go for.<br /> <br />On the social media space, it's primarily Facebook that we are seeing organizations end up being on. Of course, there are other social media channels as well as search engines that there is digital advertising on. We do have Bing, which does have a good degree of web traffic as well as ads on Twitter and Instagram, however it's really Google and Facebook where you're seeing more money being raised, though organizations are using digital advertising for really the range of communications that you can imagine an organization having including advocacy and simple awareness raising.<br /> <br />Also, I would like to note that the cost per dollar raised for the nonprofit industry as a whole, there's a lot of estimates on there that vary greatly, but I did find one estimate that was as low as four cents spent for one dollar raised, which I find difficult to believe, but it does indicate if there is that estimate out there, there probably are a lot of nonprofit organizations that are doing quite well with their digital advertising.<br /> <br />The next trend is that we are less engaged. This is one of the big reasons why you're seeing more investment in digital advertising. Now, there has been a trend for a number of years now that the level of engagement on social media networks is decreasing. Now, I did see one report that implies that that trend may be plateauing, but it's something to put serious attention to and to really consider. If it's difficult to reach people, investing more in order to make sure you're reaching people is going to be a necessity eventually.<br /> <br />Also, one of the effects of this trend is that for a while a lot of nonprofit fundraisers were putting more and more attention into social media, which was detracting the attention that they were putting into other channels. With engagement going down, nonprofits are again shifting more of their attention in online fundraising to email which has remained by far the biggest fundraising channel for nonprofits online.<br /> <br />Another trend which we still keep on seeing year after year is that Giving Tuesday continues to be a high performer. Just about every year people talk about, ""Is this going to be the year that Giving Tuesday stops seeing such incredible growth and starts plateauing?"" Every year we find out that that's not the case. The lowest year over year increase Giving Tuesday has seen since it was founded was actually a 36% increase, which as all of you know with nonprofit fundraisers is pretty damn high. In 2016, we saw a 44% increase, so Giving Tuesday is definitely not going anywhere and really still seems to be increasing by leaps and bounds.<br /> <br />This chart that you see right here is online raised by dates of funds raised for a long-time client of Big Duck. As you can see here, Giving Tuesday was actually by far the biggest day for fund raising for them for this entire campaign. It's well above even the December 31st level. Of course, not every organization is going to see this, and this was the first year that this organization conducted a Giving Tuesday campaign. That was certainly a factor, but more and more we are seeing with every organization that we work with—that Giving Tuesday tends to be the biggest day for gifts. An average gift tends to be a little bit lower, making it generally not the usually the biggest day for funds raised, but the biggest day for individual gifts.<br /> <br />That brings me to the end of the major trends that I wanted to highlight. I'll move in now to some specific tactics that you might use. Some of us take advantage of these trends and others are simply tactics that we've noticed have been increasing, which implies, of course, that nonprofits are seeing success with that. The first tactic I'll go into really reflects another trend that is a factor in most of the tactics that we'll review. That's that the nonprofit industry as a whole took a big step forward in 2016 towards more aggressive and disruptive online fundraising practices.<br /> <br />Now, while that sounds bad, the point is that the more that you disrupt someone's online experience and bring their attention to a fundraising app, the more funds you're going to raise. There's simply no way around that. Disrupting that experience gets you more dollars, just like asking more raises more.<br /> <br />The first tactic that I want to highlight is lightbox has got a lot bigger this year. This example of a full screenshot of <a href=""https://www.nrdc.org/"" target=""_blank"">NRDC's website</a> shows you that this lightbox took up really about 75% of my screen. You can still see the website on either side of it. I saw more and more lightboxes that looked like this, which fills up my entire screen. You'll notice that you can see my website tabs, so you know that I keep way too many tabs open on my computer which slows me down. One way that you can see that this is a lightbox is that if you look in the upper right corner, up on the <a href=""http://www.diabetes.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Diabetes Association</a> lightbox, you'll see a small gray X. That shows you that this is a java script lightbox that popped up when I went to this webpage. It takes up your entire screen. It makes it so that there is no scrolling to other information, and really pushes you to make that gift.<br /> <br />Another way that organizations are doing this is that they're simply redirecting traffic either to their homepage or throughout their entire site to a fundraising ask. This is a Mozilla landing page that was live during December that features the first step of a donation form. The only way that you can tell that this is not a lightbox, so it's the only way the you can tell that this is different from the <a href=""http://www.conservation.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Diabetes Association</a> example, is that in that top right corner you see a link that says, ""Continue to Mozilla.org."" It's not an X that you close a window and still remain on the same page, they've actually redirected.<br /> <br />This is really a technicality, but just one with a highlight that there is two different ways that organizations are really trapping you when you first go to their site and really pushing all of your attention onto that fundraising ask. Part of a number of the organizations that conducted these kinds of redirects actually simply put the entire donation form as their landing page. You really can't be more upfront than that about what you want your supporters to be doing.<br /> <br />I didn't see this with a lot of organizations, but last year I only saw a single organization do that in 2015. That was <a href=""http://www.conservation.org/"" target=""_blank"">Conservation International</a>, which Big Duck produced their 2015 year-end campaign. <br /> <br />We saw this tactic used by a single organization, as I said, last year, Conservation International. This year we saw really a handful of organizations doing this. Last year we went through the same list to look at 120 different organizations, so it is noticeable that from one organization to a handful, that's definitely a trend. This organization that we see right here is <a href=""https://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/"" target=""_blank"">Corporate Accountability International</a>, another Big Duck client.<br /> <br />Again, I mentioned that I conducted this webinar last year after the holiday season. For those of you who attended the last version of this webinar, you may remember that one of the biggest trends that we saw was that nonprofit websites were placing a relatively small banner all the way across the top of their pages. There was typically a banner that would stay at the top of the site when you would scroll down. Sometimes it would stay at the top of the site no matter where you went on the website. That really, really dropped off. Those banners were about the height of the green bar that you're seeing here on the <a href=""https://www.kiva.org/"" target=""_blank"">Kiva website</a>. It really trended down, but the organizations that were still doing it took up a lot more space. Again, another reflection of nonprofit organizations getting a lot more aggressive.<br /> <br />Here we have the <a href=""http://www.audubon.org/"" target=""_blank"">Audubon</a> website. While this looks like it could be a takeover or a lightbox because it fills your entire screen with a fundraising ask, this is actually just the homepage of their website. It has scrollability and more content below that. The fact that they have taken up the entire screen with this graphic image that focuses you really on a specific ask or specific bit of information is definitely a trend that we've seen in websites as a whole and with nonprofit websites in particular. It's not a year-end trend, but just a general website trend.<br /> <br />What I wanted to highlight here is just the sheer number of asks that the Audubon Society puts on their homepage. Even though they've taken up the entire screen, this first button that you see on the left-hand side includes language, “Dollar for dollar match,” so obviously drawing your attention to their year-end massive fundraising campaign and asking you to give. Over on the right there is a another button that simply says, ""Donate now."" Of course, in between them, ""Join"" and ""Renew"" are both links to donation forms.<br /> <br />Below that we have the call out over the image highlighting the year-end campaign, giving you a bit more information and asking you to give. Still below that we have a full banner stretching across the bottom of the homepage, or at least the bottom of the first screen that you see with an ask to match my guest. That is a total of six individuals asks on a single page.<br /> <br />What we have here, is really a variation of the idea of the lightbox. This is a pull-out bar from the side of the screen, that when you landed on the homepage, scrolled out to get your attention with the movement as well as with the amount of space that it takes up. This is a tactic that I'm really not seeing a lot, but I saw it on the same two websites last year as I did this year, so it must be working pretty well. You can see the sidebar here on the <a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/"" target=""_blank"">Planned Parenthood website</a> and the <a href=""http://www.bam.org/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a> also uses this tactic. It's an interesting take. It allows them to present the entire donation form in a way that still feels very engaging and attention-getting. That tab, you click on it to close it, but the tab remains on the side of the website throughout your experience there. They have these tabs on their site throughout the year, but during big campaigns they will be set to automatically open.<br /> <br />Going back to one of the trends that I highlighted is digital advertising. We are, of course, seeing more and more organizations advertising on Facebook, on Google, on Bing, and so forth. This is a tactic that eventually, within a few a years, I believe, the nonprofit industry as a whole is going to be investing in. Eventually all nonprofits, they're going to find that this is going to be a necessary strategy for them to continue raising more funds and to continue acquiring new donors.<br /> <br />That said, I would not recommend that you simply jump into this and say, ""I have to do as much as I can because there's this trend of it being harder to reach more people."" I recommend with digital advertising—as I would with really any strategy or tactic—that you approach it with a crawl, walk, run, and fly approach. The crawl stage would be you have a Google grant and maybe you're investing in a few Facebook boosted posts. Now, a boosted post is a form of advertising. It's not the Google ad that you see showing up in your sidebar or within your newsfeed. It is a post that is actually published on the nonprofits Facebook page and then invested to increase its reach either with people who have viewed the page already or to similar people or the friends of the people who like the page.<br /> <br />The targeting options are a lot broader if you are doing typical Facebook ads that allow you to target people based on their likes, based on their behavior, based on demographic information. Boosted posts tend to perform very well. It's a tactic that you can raise money in by just investing $50 even for a single boosted post. From there, if you've gained experience in the crawl stage, moving to walk would really be investing in a real campaign of year-end Facebook ads. That is a single step, but it's a fairly big step because in Facebook advertising you have the ability to test content or conduct A/B tests between campaigns, which may be testing between different contents, it may be testing between the way that you're targeting, but it provides you with the ability to improve your campaign as you go along, which implies that it needs a lot more attention.<br /> <br />You would launch two campaigns, which will run against each other. Measure it for a period of time. Once you're confident that one of the versions performs significantly better, you either simply go with that, or you then pick that and test it against another variation in order to keep on improving. It's something that requires a good amount of resources.<br /> <br />Moving from there to the run stage. Again, I would just recommend a single step from there, and that is investing in paid SEM marketing through Google. The reason why that is such a big jump, even though you may have already had a Google brand, is that—not surprisingly—the Google logarithm optimizes for paid ads. If you're paying for the ad, they want you to perform better, so they're going to make sure that you're appearing higher in searches than a grant is going to appear. I have a theory, which has never been officially confirmed, was that part of the reason other than the tax deduction that Google gives out these very generous grants, is that then increases the traffic and use of their ads which then will drive up the cost for their ad.<br /> <br />Moving on from there to the fly stage, from paid SEM you can add a stand building ad on Facebook similarly to what I described with the year-end fundraising campaign. That can be an iterative process that you're conducting A/B testing on throughout the year and also consider adding remarketing. Remarketing is when you go to a nonprofit website and then leave that site, you then see ads for that non-profit either on Google or on Facebook, whichever channel you decided to do remarketing for. Organizations we know more, of course, e-commerce companies do this, but organizations that are doing remarketing simply if you go to their website, or “for cart event,” meaning that the term comes from e-commerce that you've added an items to your cart, but you haven't completed the order.<br /> <br />For a nonprofit that would translate to you went to their donation form but you didn't complete your gift. That can be a very, very strong tactic especially because nonprofit donations forms generally only see a conversion rate of about 19 or 20%, so meaning only about 1 in 5 people who click on a link usually that explicitly says, ""Donate,"" or says, ""Please give us a gift,"" only 1 in 5 of those people actually leave a gift. Whatever happened to disrupt their experience or to change their mind, that is a very warm process.<br /> <br />Now, I bring my focus to email. I saw fewer new things happening with email this year, but one of the most prominent ones was in uptake and receipt style emails. This isn't something that seems to have picked up in a really big way, but certainly made a jump. I believe last year I only saw one of these. This year I saw a handful. With these receipt style emails, it presents the giving as something that is expected and something that they are implying, ""We are reminding you to do this thing that you said that you’d do."" There's a strong implication that you're supposed to be giving.<br /> <br />This is a very aggressive tactic, and you will see higher unsubscribe rates. If you use this tactic, you may even see a good number of people emailing to complain or even picking up the phone and calling you. Before investing in this tactic, you really have to consider how risk-averse your organization is. You have to know that while you are going to see the uptake in negative response, these emails tend to raise a lot of money. It's a gamble and an investment, that you can say that they're worth because of the funds raised, or argue that it's not worth it because of the negative response.<br /> <br />I tend to side on that if it raises such a significantly more amount of money as I have seen them do, that it is worth it. Most people who may react negatively are going to forget about it eventually, especially if you're only doing it once a year. Again, you have to consider the culture of your organization and how comfortable with more aggressive tactics your nonprofit is.<br /> <br />The other trend that I noticed on email, again, was not a huge trend, but a similar uptake. I saw it once or twice last year and I saw it a handful of times this year, are emails that are still html emails, but are coded to look like plain text emails. What this does is break up the flow of the campaign, inserting this more plain text, personal feeling email, which seems more like an email that somebody just typed up on Outlook or in Gmail and sent directly to you. It inserts that into its series of emails that are going to be the more typical, highly designed email templates than a nonprofit typically uses.<br /> <br />Now, I actually did an A/B test of this for a client of ours this past year, and that is this email that you're looking at. It's for PPMD, <a href=""http://www.parentprojectmd.org/"" target=""_blank"">Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy</a>. It's an organization that works on Duchenne, a specific form of MS that tends to affect younger boys, also girls, but it affects youth. Typically, you only live until your early 20s. It's a very heartbreaking cause, and one that Big Duck cares about a lot. I conducted an A/B test of this email against a very, very similar email on their standard, highly designed template.<br /> <br />Now, I saw that the two version performed pretty much exactly the same. When you're doing A/B testing, more often than not, you're not going to get statistically significant results that tell you you should have a high level of competence that one version of what you tested is better than the other. More often than not, you'll get directional results that show you, ""Oh, well this one performed kind of notably better, but not specifically significantly, so."" That is the reason why when you are testing something new, you generally want to test it a certain number of times. If you’re testing an A/B test of a webpage, you can simply leave that up until the results are statistically significant.<br /> <br />With email you only have that one shot for that one test. You generally want to test on even as many as five or six times before you determine which direction to go in. Just an example to give you to illustrate why that's important: I've actually conducted a series of tests for one client a few years ago in which all of the results were statistically significant, but they were evenly split with two of the emails showing that version A was the best and the other two showing that version B was up with that. Even though you see statistically significant results, it may not mean that that really is always going to be the best tactic. You have to test multiple times over time to confirm that the trend that you're seeing is real.<br /> <br />That is the end of my presentation. We left the functionality open for you to ask questions, so please do type in any questions if you have them. I see that one person has already asked one question and that is, ""Have you seen any good examples from Giving Tuesday in which the national office and chapters or affiliates are participating in the campaign in a coordinated way?"" Basically, to restate that, it's asking if I've noticed any chapter-based organizations doing Giving Tuesday well?<br /> <br />That's not something that I specifically looked for. It didn't pop out at me, so unfortunately, no, I don't. That's a very good question, particularly because chapter-based organizations often have a lot of challenges coordinating not just their tactic campaigns, but even their overall brand and communication. There's a definite trend within national chapter-based organizations towards tightening that reporting structure to give more authority to the national office. That may be something that you're seeing less now. I would certainly be interested in seeing how well chapter-based organizations do this and prescribing to a national office and a couple of chapters to see how closely aligned they are. That's a great question and I wished that I had a better answer for you.<br /> <br />I have one more question now. That is simply to explain what a lightbox is. A lightbox is when you go to a website, you see the page that you intended to land upon for a split second. Then the screen grays out to a certain degree and another window slides in, pops up, so on and so forth, with a specific ask or a specific piece of information. You then have the ability either to click and take the action requested or to select the ask or outside of the lightbox to close it and continue your website experience as you had intended it to be.<br /> <br />Now, if that still sounds confusing, the most common example that I've used that everybody seems to remember and understand is on Facebook. I believe this is still how the Facebook functionality works. If you're say in a photo album or somebody posts a photo to your feed, and you click on the image to look at it larger, the screen will gray out, and the image will load in a separate window so you can look at it at a full size. That's another example of a lightbox.<br /> <br />I'm not seeing any more questions, so I will move on. I wanted to just note at the very end just a few resources that hopefully can help you in your online fundraising as well as specifically for your year-end campaign. The first is that, of course, Big Duck is here for you. We conduct regular webinars and workshops many of which like this one are free. We also, of course, have limited availability for full campaign strategy and implementation. Meaning, if you don't have the resources to conduct your own campaign, or at least at the level that you would like them to be, Big Duck is here to provide you with an optimized campaign that will meet really the standards that you're looking for. I can say I'll personally guarantee that.<br /> <br />We do also have the Big Duck log. Here I've included a collection of specific log codes that are focused on fundraising. I'd like to recommend you take a look at one of them. Of course, I wrote it, so I'll promote myself. Sorry. Stop looking at how much you raised. That's something that I feel very strongly about, the postings have gotten a pretty good response. The idea of being that many non-profit fundraisers get too distracted by the big numbers of how much they raised, and they're not looking at the trends year over year. Take a look at that.
